  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
    <li>
      <h3>Determine where the contract was formed</h3>
      <p>Certain factors have to be considered when deciding if a worker is an  employee or a self-employed individual.</p>
      <p>These factors differ if the contract is formed in the province of Quebec  or in any other province or territory. Usually, the province or territory where  the contract was formed will decide which set of factors to use, unless the contract states something else. If the parties (worker and payer) are in a province or territory other than Quebec, common law applies. If they are in the province of Quebec, the civil code applies.</p>
      <details class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <summary>Example: Contract states under which law it should be interpreted</summary>
        <p>The contract can state that if the  worker and payer disagree about the contents of the contract, the contract will  be interpreted under Quebec law (civil code), even though the contract was  formed in Ontario (common law). </p>
      </details>
      <p>Generally, the  contract is formed when and where acceptance is received by the offeror. In  most cases, the offeror is the payer. </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Example: Payer and worker are in the same province or territory </summary>
        <p>John (worker) is in Surrey, BC when he verbally agrees to work as a music teacher for a community school (payer) in Coquitlam, BC. The contract was formed in BC. Since the parties are in a province or territory other than Quebec, common law applies. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Example: Payer and worker are in different provinces or territory</summary>
        <p>Iman is an audiologist and she lives in Cornwall, Ontario. She applied to work for the clinic Bonne Entente (a payer) in Montreal, Quebec. Two days ago, she had a virtual interview, and today, the owner of the clinic called her to offer her a position.  Soon after, she received an email with a written contract which she signed and sent back by email. In this situation, the contract was formed in Quebec because this is where the payer was when the acceptance was received. Since the payer is in Quebec, the civil code applies. </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Review the appropriate factors to determine the employment status</h3>
      <p> There are different considerations, depending on where the contract was formed. </p>

            <p>When the CRA examines whether a person is an employee or a self-employed individual, the key question to ask is whether the person is engaged to carry out services as a person in business on their own account, or as an employee. To do this, we examine the total relationship between the worker and the payer, using a 2-step approach.</p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
              <li>
                <h3> Determine the intention of the parties </h3>
                <p>The CRA asks the worker and the payer what their intent was when they  entered into the working arrangement.</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-md">
                  <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Did the 2 parties intend to enter into  a <strong>contract of service</strong> (employer-employee relationship)? </li>
                  <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Did the 2 parties  intend to enter into a <strong>contract for services</strong> (business  relationship)? </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The CRA needs to know how they defined their working relationship and  why they defined it as such.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the intention is clear and both parties are in agreement  (common intent). Sometimes the intent can be found in a written agreement.  Sometimes the two parties have a different understanding as to the status of  their working relationship, in which case there is no common intent.</p>
                <p>To decide the parties&rsquo; intentions, the CRA gets a copy of the contract,  or testimony by the parties and examines the parties&rsquo; actions. Both parties&rsquo;  intentions form part of the context of the employment that the CRA analyses.</p>
                <p>Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs; however,  the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship. In  other words, all of the facts, including the actual terms and conditions of  employment, determine a worker's employment status, not just the intention.</p>
              </li>
              <li id="factors">
                <h3> Factors to consider to determine the employment status </h3>
                <p>The CRA asks the worker and the payer questions that will help us  understand the working relationship and allow us to verify whether the intent  of the parties is reflected in the facts.</p>
                <p>These questions relate to the following elements:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the       level of control the payer has over the worker's activities</li>
                  <li>whether       the worker or payer provides the tools and equipment</li>
                  <li>whether       the worker can subcontract the work or hire assistants</li>
                  <li>the       degree of financial risk the worker takes</li>
                  <li>the       degree of responsibility for investment and management the worker holds</li>
                  <li>the worker's       opportunity for profit</li>
                  <li>any       other relevant factors, such as written contracts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The CRA looks at the answers separately for each element and then  together.</p>
                <p>The CRA considers whether they reflect the stated intention and decides  if the actual working conditions are more consistent with a <strong>contract of  service</strong> or with a <strong>contract for services</strong>.</p>
                <p>To help you understand the process, the CRA explains each factor below and provides some indicators that show that the worker may be an employee or a self-employed individual.</p>
                <ol class="lst-stps-sub stps-strpd ld-zr">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Control</h4>
                    <p>Control is the ability, authority, or right of a payer to exercise control over a worker concerning the manner in which the work is done and what work will be done.</p>
                    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                      <dt>Degree of control or independence</dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p>Consider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of  independence held by the worker.</p>
                        <p>The actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the  skills of the worker.</p>
                        <p>Deciding the degree of control can be difficult when examining the  employment of professionals such as engineers, doctors, and IT consultants.  Because of their expertise and specialized training, they may need little or no  specific direction in their daily activities. When examining the factor of  control, it is necessary to focus on both the payer's control over the worker's  daily activities and the payer's influence over the worker.</p>
                      </dd>
                      <dt>Payer's right to exercise control</dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p>It is the right of the payer to exercise control that is relevant, <strong>not</strong> whether  the payer actually exercises this right.</p>
                        <p>It is the control of a payer over a worker that is relevant and <strong>not</strong> the  control of a payer over the end result of a product or service purchased.</p>
                      </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is an employee</summary>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The       relationship is one of subordination. The payer will often direct,       scrutinize, and effectively control many elements of how and when the work       is carried out</li>
                        <li>The       payer controls the worker with respect to both the results of the work and       the method used to do the work</li>
                        <li>The       payer chooses and controls the method and amount of pay. Salary       negotiations may still take place in an employer-employee relationship</li>
                        <li>The       payer decides what jobs the worker will do</li>
                        <li>The       payer chooses to listen to the worker's suggestions but has the final word</li>
                        <li>The worker       requires permission to work for other payers while working for this payer</li>
                        <li>Where       the schedule is irregular, priority on the worker's time is an indication       of control over the worker</li>
                        <li>The       worker receives training or direction from the payer on how to do the       work. The overall work environment between the worker and the payer is one       of subordination</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual</summary>
                      <ul>
                        <li>A       self-employed individual usually works independently</li>
                        <li>The       worker does not have anyone overseeing their activities</li>
                        <li>The       worker is usually free to work when and for whom they choose and may       provide their services to different payers at the same time</li>
                        <li>The       worker can accept or refuse work from the payer</li>
                        <li>The       working relationship between the payer and the worker does <strong>not</strong> present       a degree of continuity, loyalty, security, subordination, or integration,       all of which are generally associated with an employer-employee       relationship</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Tools and equipment</h4>
                    <p>Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor. </p>
                    <p>What is relevant is the significant investment in the tools and equipment along with the cost of replacement, repair, and insurance. A worker who has made a significant investment is likely to retain a right over the use of these assets, diminishing the payer's control over how the work is carried out. In addition, such a significant investment may place the worker at a risk of a financial loss. </p>
                    <p><strong>Note</strong> Tools and equipment can vary widely in terms of value and can include everything from wrenches and hammers, to specialized clothing, appliances, stethoscopes, musical instruments, computers, and vehicles such as trucks and tractors. </p>
                    <p>Self-employed individuals often supply the tools and equipment required for a contract. As a result, the ownership of tools and equipment by a worker is more commonly associated with a business relationship. </p>
                    <p>However, employees sometimes also have to provide their own tools. The courts have acknowledged that because a worker is required to provide tools of the trade, this does not in itself mean that the worker is a self-employed individual. For example, many skilled tradespeople such as auto mechanics have to supply their own tools, even if they are full-time employees. </p>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is an employee</summary>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The       payer supplies most of the tools and equipment the worker needs. In       addition, the payer is responsible for repair, maintenance, and insurance       costs</li>
                        <li>The       payer retains the right of use over the tools and equipment provided to       the worker</li>
                        <li>The       worker supplies the tools and equipment and the payer reimburses the       worker for their use</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual</summary>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The       worker provides the tools and equipment needed for the work. In addition,       the worker is responsible for the costs of repairs, insurance, and       maintenance to the tools and equipment</li>
                        <li>The       worker has made a significant investment in the tools and equipment and       the worker retains the right over the use of these assets</li>
                        <li>The       worker supplies their own workspace, is responsible for the costs to       maintain it, and does substantial work from that site</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Subcontracting work or hiring assistants</h4>
                    <p>Consider if the worker can subcontract work or hire assistants. This factor can help decide a worker's business presence because subcontracting work or hiring assistants can affect their chance of profit and risk of loss.</p>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is an employee</summary>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The worker cannot hire helpers or assistants</li>
                        <li>The worker does not have the ability to hire and send replacements. The worker has to do the work personally</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual</summary>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The worker does not have to carry out the services personally. They can hire another party to either do the work or help do the work, and pay the costs for doing so</li>
                        <li>The payer has no say in whom the worker hires</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Financial risk</h4>
                    <p>Consider the degree of financial risk taken by the worker. Consider if there are any fixed ongoing costs incurred by the worker or any expenses that are not reimbursed.</p>
                    <p>Usually, employees will not have any financial risk as any expenses will be reimbursed, and they will not have fixed ongoing costs.</p>
                    <p>Self-employed individuals, on the other hand, can have financial risk and incur losses because they usually pay fixed monthly costs even if work is not currently being done.</p>
                    <p>Employees and self-employed individuals may be reimbursed for business or travel expenses. Therefore, focus on the expenses that are <strong>not</strong> reimbursed by the payer.</p>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is an employee</summary>
                      <ul>

                    <h4>Opportunity for profit</h4>
                    <p>Consider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as  this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered  and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit  and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and  one could exceed the other.</p>
                    <p>This factor has to be considered from the worker's perspective, not the  payer's. It is for the most part an assessment of the degree to which the  worker can control their proceeds and expenses.</p>
                    <p>Employees normally do not have the chance of a profit and risk of a loss even though their remuneration can vary depending on the terms of their  employment contracts. For example, employees working on a commission or  piece-rate basis, or employees with a productivity bonus clause in their  contract can increase their earnings based on their productivity. This increase  in income is not normally viewed as a profit, as it is not the excess of  proceeds over expenses.</p>
                    <p>Employees may have expenses directly related to their employment, such  as automobile expenses, and board and lodging costs. Normally, expenses would  not place employees at risk of incurring a loss because it is unlikely that the  expenses would be greater than their remuneration.</p>
                    <p>Self-employed individuals normally have the chance of profit or risk of  loss, because they have the ability to pursue and accept contracts as they see  fit. They can negotiate the price (or unilaterally set their prices) for their  services and have the right to offer those services to more than one payer.  Self-employed individuals will normally incur expenses to carry out the terms  and conditions of their contracts, and to manage those expenses to maximize net  earnings. Self-employed individuals can increase their proceeds and/or decrease  their expenses in an effort to increase profit.</p>
                    <p>Employees generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by  the payer's business.</p>
                    <p>The method of payment may help to decide if the worker has the  opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss. In an employer-employee  relationship, the worker is normally guaranteed a return for the work done and  is usually paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, or similar basis.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, some self-employed individuals are paid on an hourly  basis. However, when a worker is paid a flat rate for the work done, it  generally indicates a business relationship, especially if the worker incurs  expenses in doing the work.</p>
