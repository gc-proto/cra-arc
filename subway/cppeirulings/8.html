      <h3 id="h-1">Review what pensionable and insurable employment is </h3>
      <ol class="lst-stps-sub">
        <li>
          <h4>What is pensionable employment</h4>
          <p>Under the CPP, pensionable employment includes most <strong>employment in Canada under a contract of service</strong>  (employer-employee relationship). </p>
          <p>However, there are exceptions. For example, in certain situations: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>an <strong>employee</strong> in Canada <strong>may not</strong> have pensionable employment. For example, some employment at a circus or fair;</li>
            <li>employment that is <strong>partially or entirely outside Canada</strong> may be pensionable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the employment is pensionable, both the employee and the employer contribute to the CPP.</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Example: Where employment <strong>outside Canada</strong> is pensionable</summary>
            <p>Aya works for SunCan, located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She is an expert on the new payroll program. Her employer asks her to help train her colleagues at SunUS, a factory located in California, for a period of 2 months. Because she ordinarily reports for work at an establishment of her employer in Canada, her employment is pensionable.</p>
          </details>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>What is insurable employment</h4>
          <p>Under the EIA, insurable employment includes most <strong>employment in Canada under a contract of service</strong> (employer-employee relationship). </p>
          <p>However, there are exceptions. In certain situations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>an <strong>employee</strong> in Canada <strong>may not</strong> have insurable employment. For example:
               <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>when the employer and the employee are related and they do not deal at arm’s length, or when the employee is a shareholder who controls more than 40% of the voting shares of the employer’s corporation; </li></ul></li>
            <li>the employment of workers who are <strong>not employees</strong> may be insurable. For example, the employment of barbers and hairdressers, or fishers;</li>
            <li>employment that is partially or entirely <strong>outside Canada</strong> may be insurable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When the employment is insurable, both the worker and the employer contribute to the EI. </p>
          <details>
            <summary>Example: Where employment of <strong>an employee</strong> is <strong>not insurable</strong></summary>
            <p>Martin and his sister Nadia are both employees of Garage MNO Inc. Martin is in charge of staffing, accounting, and client service, while Nadia, as a mechanic, supervises the employees. They both receive a set salary every week, are entitled to vacation and health insurance. They each own 50% of the voting shares of the Garage MNO Inc. Their employment is therefore not insurable because they each control more than 40% of the voting shares of Garage MNO Inc.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Example: Where employment of a worker who is <strong>not an employee</strong> is insurable</summary>
            <p>Julia works as a hairdresser for Hair Salon Inc., a hairdressing business owned and operated by Miguel. She rents a chair, provides her tools, such as clippers, scissors and hair products and has her own list of clients.  She also sets the price of her services and determines her own schedule. Although she is not an employee, her employment is included in insurable employment under the Employment Insurance Regulations (EIR).</p>
