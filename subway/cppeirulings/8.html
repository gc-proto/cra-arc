  <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr">
    <li>
      <h3 id="h-1">Understand what pensionable employment is</h3>
      <p>Pensionable employment under the Canada Pension Plan includes most employment in Canada under a contract of service (employer-employee relationship).</p>
      <p>Certain workers who are employees might not  have pensionable employment.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Example: Where employment is not pensionable</summary>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>First Nations workers</dt>
          <dd>The employment of a First Nations employee whose earnings are not included in taxable  income under the Income Tax Act is not pensionable employment.</dd>
        </dl>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 id="h-2">Understand what insurable employment is</h3>
      <p>Insurable employment under the Employment insurance legislation includes most employment in Canada under a contract of service (employer-employee relationship).</p>
      <p>Some <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/cpp-ei-explained/canada-pension-plan-employment-insurance-explained-7.html">employments outside Canada</a> are also  insurable. </p>
      <p>Certain workers who are <strong>not</strong> employees  might be considered to be in insurable employment. Examples are barbers and  hairdressers, or fishers. </p>
      <p>Certain workers who are employees might not be considered to be in insurable employment. </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Example:  Where employment is not insurable</summary>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>Non-arm's length relationship</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>If an  employee is not dealing at arm's length with the employer, it is possible that  their employment is not insurable under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.6/index.html">Employment  Insurance Act</a>.</p>

          </dd>
          <dt>Control of shares</dt>
          <dd> If an employee of a corporation controls more  than 40% of the voting shares of that corporation, their employment is not  insurable; however, the employee can register with the CEIC <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-self-employed-workers.html">for access to employment  insurance special benefits. </a> </dd>
