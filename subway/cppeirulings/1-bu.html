  <p>Employment status directly affects a person's  entitlement to employment insurance (EI) benefits under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.6/index.html">Employment Insurance Act</a>. It can also have an impact on how a worker is treated under  other legislation such as the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-8/index.html">Canada Pension Plan</a> and the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html">Income Tax Act</a>.</p>
  <p>Additionally, it affects how an individual and  business meet their obligations and how they report to the Canada Revenue  Agency (CRA).</p>

      <details id="details-panel1">
        <summary>Employee status</summary>
        <p>In an employer-employee relationship, the payer is considered an  employer and the worker an employee. Employers are responsible for deducting  Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions, EI premiums, and income tax from  remuneration, or other amounts they pay to their employees. Employers  must remit these deductions along with their share of CPP contributions  and EI premiums to the CRA.</p>
        <p>An employer who fails to deduct the required CPP contributions or  EI premiums has to pay both the employer's share and the employee's share  of any contributions and premiums owing, plus penalties and interest. For more  employer information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/calculating-deductions.html">Calculate  payroll deductions and contributions</a>.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>If the employee's province of employment is Quebec</summary>
          <p>If the employee's province of employment is Quebec, employers have to  deduct Québec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions instead of CPP contributions and  Québec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) premiums. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a>.  </p>

      <details id="details-panel2">
        <summary>Self-employed status</summary>
        <p>If the worker is <strong>self-employed</strong>, they must  operate a business and be engaged in a business relationship with the payer.  For more information on tax obligations for self-employed workers, go  to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/business/taxes.html">Business taxes</a>.</p>
        <p>Self-employed workers pay both the employer's and the employee's share  of CPP contributions when they file their <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">T1  income tax and benefit return</a> using <a https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s8.html">5000-S8 Schedule 8 - Canada Pension Plan Contributions and Overpayment (for all except QC)</a>. </p>
        <p>Self-employed workers do not pay EI premiums unless they opt into the EI  program for access to employment insurance special benefits, which include  maternity, parental, sickness, compassionate care, and family caregiver  benefits. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html">Service Canada</a>. </p>
