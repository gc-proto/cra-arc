  <p>Applies to <a href="7.html#stp1">contracts formed</a> in Quebec.</p>
  <p>When determining whether a person is an employee or a self-employed worker in the province of Quebec, you have to examine the relationship between the worker and the payer, using a 3-step approach. The CRA uses this approach, which is based on civil law, to determine the employment status of a worker during the <a href="index-ruling.html">CPP/EI ruling process</a>. </p>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
    <li>
      <h3> Determine the intention of the parties </h3>
      <p>Determine what was the intention of the worker and the payer when they entered into the working arrangement/contract. </p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-md">
        <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Did the 2 parties intend to enter into  a <strong>contract of service</strong> (employer-employee relationship)? </li>
        <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Did the 2 parties  intend to enter into a <strong>contract for services</strong> (business  relationship)? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is important to know how they defined their working relationship and why they defined it as such.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the intention is clear and both parties are in agreement (<strong>common intention</strong>). Sometimes the two parties have a different understanding of the status of their employment relationship, in which case there is <strong>no common intention</strong>.</p>
      <p>Both parties’ intentions form part of the context of the employment to analyse. The parties’ intentions may be found in a written contract, or by asking the worker and the payer what their intention was and by examining the parties’ actions.</p>
      <p>Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs; however, the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship. In other words, it is all of the facts, including the actual terms and conditions of employment, that determine a worker's employment status, not just the intention.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="step2">
      <h3>Consider factors to determine if employment meets CCQ definition of a contract of employment or a contract for services </h3>
      <p>Determine if the employment meets the definition of a contract of employment or of a business contract (contract for services) as defined in the Civil Code of Québec by considering the following factors:</p>
      <ul class="mrgn-bttm-md">
        <li>carrying out the work</li>
        <li>remuneration</li>
        <li>relationship of subordination</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is important to gather the facts and analyze them in light of the specific context of the employment and the intention of the parties.</p>
      <p>To help you understand the process and make a determination, each factor is briefly explained and some indicators are provided to show whether a relationship of subordination exists. </p>
      <ol class="lst-stps-sub stps-strpd ld-zr">
        <li>
          <h4>Carrying out the work</h4>
          <p>Whether there is an employer-employee relationship or a business  relationship, the worker has to do the work. It can be part-time or  full-time for a specified or indeterminate period.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Remuneration</h4>
          <p>Remuneration means how a worker is paid. It includes all consideration  and benefits that have a monetary value. Whether there is an employer-employee  relationship or a business relationship, the worker will receive remuneration  in exchange for work. The remuneration can be calculated by time, by the piece,  or in another manner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Relationship of subordination</h4>
          <p>This factor helps distinguish the employer-employee relationship from a  business relationship. </p>
          <p>The relationship of subordination is the capacity, the authority, or the  right of a payer to exercise control over the worker's activities and the  manner in which the work is done.</p>
          <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>Degree of control or independence</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Consider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of  independence held by the worker.</p>
              <p>The actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the  skills of the worker.</p>
              <p>Deciding the degree of control can be difficult when examining the  employment of professionals such as engineers, doctors, and IT consultants.  Because of their expertise and specialized training, they may require little or  no specific direction in their daily activities. When examining the factor of  control, it is necessary to focus on both the payer's control over the worker's  daily activities and the payer's influence over the worker.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Payer's right to exercise control</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>It is the right of the payer to exercise control that is relevant, <strong>not</strong> whether  the payer actually exercises this right.</p>
              <p>It is the control of a payer over a worker that is relevant and <strong>not</strong> the  control of a payer over the end result of a product or service that they have  purchased.</p>

            <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is an employee</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>The       payer directs and controls many elements of how the work is done       (such as what, who, where, when, and how)</li>
              <li>The       payer controls the worker's absences, such as sick leave or vacation       leave</li>
              <li>The       payer controls the worker with respect to the results of the work and the       method used to do the work</li>
              <li>The       payer creates the work schedule and establishes the worker's rules of       conduct</li>
              <li>The       payer can impose disciplinary actions on a worker</li>
              <li>The       worker has to do the work personally</li>
              <li>The       worker has to remit activity reports to the payer</li>
              <li>The       worker's activities are reserved to a single payer (exclusivity of       services)</li>
              <li>The       worker receives training or direction from the payer on how to do the       work</li>
              <li>The       worker accepts being part of the payer's business to have the latter       benefit from their work</li>
              <li>The       parties have inserted a non-competition clause in their written contract</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Indicators showing that the worker is  self-employed </summary>
            <ul>
              <li>The       worker is usually free to work when and for whom they choose and may       provide their services to different payers at the same time</li>
              <li>The       worker does not have to carry out the services personally. They can       hire another person to either do the work or help do the work</li>
              <li>The       worker can generally choose the time and the manner in which the work will       be done</li>
              <li>The       worker does not need to be at the payer's premises</li>
              <li>The       worker can accept or refuse work from the payer</li>
              <li>The       working relationship between the payer and the worker does <strong>not</strong> present       a degree of continuity, loyalty, security, subordination, or integration,       all of which are generally associated with an employer-employee       relationship</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Since in certain working relationships it can be difficult to decide whether there is a relationship of subordination, consider reviewing indicators used in common law, found in the section <strong>Contract formed outside of Quebec</strong> under <a href="3a.html#factors">Consider factors to understand working relationship and whether facts reflect intention of parties</a>.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>Compare the intention of the parties with their actual working relationship</h3>
      <p>Compare each party's intentions with their actual working relationship and decide whether the conditions of the working relationship represent the status that the parties have chosen and that they are consistent with the definitions of the Civil Code of Québec.</p>
