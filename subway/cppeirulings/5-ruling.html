<h2 id="h-4">Ruling period that applies to a decision</h2>
<p>A ruling applies to a specific period or periods of employment. A decision letter will include the names of the worker and the payer, and whether the employment is pensionable or insurable, or both, for the period or periods of employment. Unless a decision is appealed, it is final.</p>
<p>If the terms and conditions of the employment change after the ruling is issued, and you do not know if the employment is pensionable or insurable, or both, you can ask for another ruling. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/cpp-ei-explained/canada-pension-plan-employment-insurance-explained-11.html">How to get a CPP/EI ruling</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-5">How to appeal a CPP/EI ruling</h2>
<p>If you disagree with a ruling, you can appeal. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p133.html">Booklet P133, Your Appeal Rights – Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance Coverage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-6">How to give service feedback</h2>
<p>You can give service feedback by submitting a service compliment, suggestion or complaint. For information on providing service-related feedback, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/make-a-service-complaint.html">Send feedback about CRA service</a>.</p>
