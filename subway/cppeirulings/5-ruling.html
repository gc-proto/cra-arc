  <h2 id="h-1">Ruling period that applies to a decision</h2>
  <p>A  ruling applies to a specific period or periods of employment. A ruling letter  will include the names of the worker and the payer, and whether the employment  is pensionable or insurable, or both, for the period or periods of employment.  Unless a ruling is appealed, it is final.</p>
  <p>If  the terms and conditions of the employment change after the ruling is issued,  and you do not know if the employment is pensionable or insurable, or both, you  can ask for another ruling. For more information, go to <a href="index-ruling.html">Request  a CPP/EI ruling</a>.</p>
