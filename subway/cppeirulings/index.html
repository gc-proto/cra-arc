      <p>Workers usually fall into one of two categories:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or  cnjnctn-sm mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li class="cnjnctn-col-80"> An <strong>employee</strong>
          <details class="mrgn-tp-md">
            <summary>What is an employee</summary>
            <p>Generally, <strong>an employee</strong> is hired to  perform work under the direction and control of the person or business who hires  them under a contract of service (employer/employee relationship). Under the  terms and conditions of employment, an employee does not normally have the  chance to make a profit or suffer a loss. An employee is not seen as operating  their own business, but rather as being an integral part of the payer&rsquo;s  business. An employee may be entitled to benefits, be paid for vacation time,  or be covered by a collective agreement.</p>
          </details>
        </li>
        <li class="cnjnctn-col"> A <strong>self-employed worker</strong>
          <details class="mrgn-tp-md">
            <summary>What is a self-employed worker</summary>
            <p>A <strong>self-employed worker</strong> carries on their  own business. The self-employed worker enters into a contract for services  (business relationship) with the person or business (the payer) they provide  the services to. In this relationship, the self-employed worker agrees to provide  services, is free to choose the means of performing the contract and is not  under the direction or control of the payer.</p>
          </details>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use this guidance if you are:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A payer or employer</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A worker</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It will help you understand how to determine a  worker's employment status.</p>
      <p>Payers and workers can set their employment arrangement as  they want. However, whether they choose an employee or self-employed status,  they must make sure that the facts of their working relationship support that employment  status.</p>
