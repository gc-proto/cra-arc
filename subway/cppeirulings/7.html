  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
    <li id="stp1">
      <h3>Determine where the contract was formed</h3>
      <p>Canada has two systems of law: the civil law in Quebec, and the common law in the other provinces or territories.</p>
      <p>Certain factors have to be considered to determine if a worker is an  employee or is self-employed.</p>
      <p>These factors differ if the contract (oral or written) is formed in the province of Quebec or in any other province or territory. Usually, the province or territory where the contract was formed will decide which set of factors to use, unless the contract states something else. If the parties (worker and payer) are in a province or territory other than Quebec, common law applies. If they are in the province of Quebec, the Civil Code of Québec (CCQ) applies.</p>
     
      <p>Generally, the  contract is formed when and where acceptance is received by the offeror. In  most cases, the offeror is the payer. </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Example: Payer and worker are in the same province or territory </summary>
        <p>John (worker) is in Surrey, BC when he verbally agrees to work as a music teacher for a community school (payer) in Coquitlam, BC. The contract was formed in BC. Since the parties are in a province or territory other than Quebec, common law applies. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Example: Payer and worker are in different provinces or territory</summary>
        <p>Iman is an audiologist and she lives in Cornwall, Ontario. She applied to work for the clinic Bonne Entente (a payer) in Montreal, Quebec. Two days ago, she had a virtual interview, and today, the owner of the clinic called her to offer her a position.  Soon after, she received an email with a written contract which she signed and sent back by email. In this situation, the contract was formed in Quebec because this is where the payer, the offeror,  was when the acceptance was received. Since the payer is in Quebec, the CCQ applies. </p>
      </details>
        <details class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <summary>Example: Contract states under which law it should be interpreted</summary>
        <p>The contract can state that if the  worker and payer disagree about the contents of the contract, the contract will  be interpreted under Quebec law (CCQ), even though the contract was  formed in Ontario (common law). </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li id="stp2">
      <h3>Examine approach to determine the employment status</h3>
      <p>There are different considerations to determine the employment status of a worker, depending on where the contract was formed.</p>
      <p>You will use a two-step approach which is based on common law principles and on jurisprudence when the contract was formed in a province of territory other than Quebec, and a three step-approach which is based on civil law, when the contract was formed in Quebec.</p>
      <p>Select the location where the contract was formed to obtain more information on the approach to use:</p>
