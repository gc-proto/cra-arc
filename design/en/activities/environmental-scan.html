      <p>There are 3 steps in this activity.</p>
      <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr">
        <li>
          <h3>Determine scope of scan</h3>
          <p>Environmental scans can be very quick reviews of a few relevant sources or very in depth research and analysis. Start by identifying the types of research that are needed for your project, based on the available resources and timelines, as well as the nature of the project. Some of the types of research you could consider are described below in Step 2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Conduct research and collect findings</h3>
          <p>The following are some of the types of research you could conduct during your environmental scan:</p>
          <h4>Social media analysis</h4>
          <p>Conduct a review of publicly accessible content on social media platforms to discover trends in conversations related to the content that you're working on.</p>
          <p>This will help you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify user tasks, user challenges with content, gaps in content (from complaints)</li>
            <li>Understand how the CRA and its service are perceived in social media</li>
            <li>Learn more about trends and opinions related to the content</li>
            <li>Identify relevant influencers</li>
            <li>Identify relevant conversations</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Media analysis</h4>
          <p>Review content from the media organizations that report on personal or business finances, as well as other topics related to the CRA's content. Consider reading the comments on articles as well to get a sense of public sentiment on the issue.</p>
          <h4>Similar government websites</h4>
          <p>Conduct a review of similar government websites and review their content and design approaches. Look at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>provincial/territorial tax departments and agencies (e.g. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia)</li>
            <li>other countries' tax departments and agencies (in particular the UK and Australian governments)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While reviewing the websites, take notes and screen shots of interesting approaches, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Well written content and good plain language terminology (with caution, as the terminology people use may vary from one country to another)</li>
            <li>Good visual design and content design practices</li>
            <li>Useful functionality</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Related government content outside the CRA</h4>
          <p>Review content from outside CRA that is related to the content that you're working on. This could include related themes on canada.ca or content from other levels of government. You may have created a list already while developing the <a href="content-inventory.html">content inventory</a>.</p>
          <p>Review the content to better understand how the CRA's content fits into the broader landscape of government content on that topic.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How does the Canada Child Benefit fit into government content on becoming a parent overall?</li>
            <li>How does content on getting a Business Number fit into content on starting a business overall?</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Related non-government content</h4>
          <p>Scan key web pages outside the government relating to the topic to see how they write about and present content on the issue.</p>
          <p>This could include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Content from tax software or tax return preparation companies</li>
            <li>Related content aimed at particular target audiences, such as people with disabilities, youth, business owners, new parents, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Research reports</h4>
          <p>Check whether there is any relevant research related to your project, in addition to research on user needs that you've already collected. The <a href="https://itb-dgi-lse-esl.isvcs.net/sibrinv/prot/lst.action">CRA Research inventory</a> is one potential source of relevant research. Google searches on relevant keywords may uncover other research that has been completed by academics and other researchers.</p>
          <h4>Interviews with specialists and subject matter experts</h4>
          <p>Consider reaching out to subject matter experts if you need additional information. This could include talking to individual external experts in a field or consulting with relevant groups, such as advisory committees or associations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Report on findings</h3>
          <p>Document the findings of your research in a way that is easy to communicate to the core project team. This could include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Slide presentation</li>
            <li>Written document</li>
            <li>Online whiteboard</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Use a combination of visuals (e.g. screenshots of sample websites) and text (explanations of the relevance of what you found).</p>
          <p>Prepare a summary of the key points that the team wants to bring forward for consideration in the design phase. Some of the significant findings could also be incorporated into presentations to the extended project team if they help explain the recommended approach.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>Take any key points from the environmental scan and bring them forward to other relevant activities like <a href="identification-user-tasks.html">identification of user tasks for improvement</a> or research synthesis.</p>
      <h2 id="h_4">Deliverables and artifacts</h2>
      <p>When you're done, you should have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a slide presentation, written document or online whiteboard with your findings</li>
      </ul>
