      <p>The best place to put answers to people's questions is at the point of need in clear task-based content. When important answers are hidden in FAQs, people are forced to do more searching and reading to find the answer to their questions. </p>

      <h2 id="h_1">Why avoid FAQs</h2>

      <p>When writing web content, avoid using FAQs because: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Separating FAQs from core content sends people on a scavenger hunt looking for answers</li>
        <li>FAQs often reflect the questions the organization wants to answer, rather than the questions users are frequently asking</li>
        <li>FAQs are often redundant (duplicating content found in other places, which creates unnecessary overhead because the content needs to be kept up to date in multiple places)</li>
        <li>FAQs are sometimes contradictory (when they are forgotten and not updated when other content is updated, which can pose a legal risk)</li>
        <li>It is difficult to front-load (start with) important keywords in a question</li>
        <li>Questions are generally longer than statements, which usually makes them more difficult to understand</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 id="h_2">How to avoid FAQs</h2>

      <h3 id="h_2_1">Write headings that give answers</h3>

      <p>Instead of phrasing your headings as a question, write clear headings that give answers or instructions.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Example: Rewrite questions as headings that give answers</summary>
        <p><strong>Write</strong>: Sign up for direct deposit to get payments faster</p>

        <p><strong>Don’t write</strong>: Is direct deposit available? How do I sign up for direct deposit?</p>

        <p class="mrgn-tp-lg"><strong>Write</strong>: Use Manage my profile in My Business Account to add another business to your account</p>

        <p><strong>Don’t write</strong>: What if I have more than one business?</p>

        <p class="mrgn-tp-lg"><strong>Write</strong>: No GST/HST on imported face masks, respirators and face shields</p>

        <p><strong>Don’t write</strong>: Will the importation of the face masks, respirators and face shields that are proposed to be zero-rated be relieved of GST/HST?</p>

      </details>

      <h3 id="h_2_2">Answer questions at the point of need</h3>

      <p>Your content should answer people's questions when and where they need it. Monitor call drivers and user feedback, and update your content regularly with answers to the questions that people are asking. Include the answers in the most logical place within the task-based content, not in a separate FAQs section.</p>

      <p>If it is information that most people will be looking for (primary information), then make sure the answers are easy to find and understand in the core content.</p>

      <p>If only some people will be looking for those answers (secondary information), put the answers at the point of need but in a way that doesn't interfere with the journey of people who do not need those answers. For example, on a web page, put those answers in an <a href="https://design.canada.ca/common-design-patterns/collapsible-content.html">expand-collapse</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="h_2_3">Use rescue links to prevent unnecessary calls</h3>

      <p>The one place it is sometimes appropriate to use FAQs is on a Contact Us page. When someone has already decided to call, well-placed answers can give them the information they need and prevent them from having to call. However, the answers do not need to be formatted as questions and answers. </p>

      <p>To make answers on a Contact Us page effective: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Monitor the things that people call most frequently about</li>
        <li>Provide answers to their questions directly on the page or through <a href="../design-systems/gcweb/links/index.html#h-1-8">rescue links</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>For example, if data tells you that people call most frequently to change their address, to ask about the next benefit payment date and to get help resetting their password for MyAccount, you can add those links to a contact page above the appropriate phone number. </p>
