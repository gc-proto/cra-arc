            <p>Generally, deliveries to consumers (such as most online shopping) are shipped <strong>on behalf of the seller</strong>. This means we consider those items delivered when <strong>the item arrives at the destination address</strong>.</p>

                <li>Sends the item by mail or courier to the recipient, we consider the item to have been delivered to the recipient at the time <strong>the supplier mails the item or transfers it to the courier</strong></li>

</ul>
    <p>The items that qualify for GST/HST relief during this period qualify whether they are being throughout the supply chain, whether they are being supplied from a manufacturer to a wholesaler, from a wholesaler, or from a retailer to a consumer.</p>

    <p>Imported goods qualify for GST/HST relief as long as they meet the other qualifying conditions. </p>

			<h4>Prepared meals</h4> 

<p>Prepared meals and food, as well as all non-alcoholic beverages and eligible alcoholic beverages qualify for GST/HST relief during the eligible period (December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025) when they are provided at restaurants, pubs, bars, food trucks, and other establishments that serve food and/or beverages. Cannabis products that are food or beverages do not qualify for GST/HST relief.</p>

<h4>Food delivery</h4>
			<p>When an <strong>eating establishment bills a customer directly for delivery</strong> of a prepared meal, the <strong>delivery service qualifies</strong> for GST/HST relief during the eligible period because it generally has the same tax status as the prepared meal.</p>
<p>However, when a delivered prepared meal is <strong>ordered through a platform</strong>, two separate transactions occur: 
<ul>
	<li>The prepared meal is provided by the eating establishment to the customer</li>
	<li>A delivery service is provided by the platform provider to the customer</li>
</ul>
	<p>The <strong>prepared meal provided by the eating establishment</strong> to the customer <strong>qualifies</strong> for GST/HST relief during the eligible period.</p>
			<p>The <strong>delivery service made by the platform provider</strong> to the customer <strong>does not qualify</strong> for GST/HST relief. </p>


<h4>Orders that include both qualifying and non-qualifying items</h4>
<p>GST/HST relief <strong>only applies to the qualifying items</strong> (prepared meals, non-alcoholic beverages and eligible alcoholic beverages).</p>
<p>When customers order prepared meals or eligible beverages which qualify for GST/HST relief during the eligible period, the GST/HST does not apply on these items. </p>
<p>However, where a customer orders alcoholic beverages which do <strong>not</strong> qualify for GST/HST relief (such as spirits and liqueurs), the GST/HST still applies on those items. </p>
<h4 id="cocktails">Cocktails and mixed beverages</h4>
<p>Some beverages that are mixed <strong>at the establishment</strong> for customers (such as cocktails) may also qualify for GST/HST relief. </p>
<p><strong>Mixed drinks that include only eligible beverages</strong> such as beer, malt liquor, wine, <strong>qualify</strong> for GST/HST relief. </p>
<p><span class="fas fa-fw fa-check text-success mrgn-lft-sm"></span> For example, a mimosa made of sparkling wine and orange juice, or a michelada made of beer and non-alcoholic ingredients would qualify</p>
<p><strong>Mixed drinks that include an alcoholic beverage which does not qualify</strong> for GST/HST relief, such as spirits or liqueurs, would <strong>not qualify</strong> for GST/HST relief.</p> 
<p><span class="fas fa-fw fa-times text-danger mrgn-lft-sm"></span> For example, a sangria that includes both wine and rum, or a mixed drink such as a vodka and soda, would <strong>not</strong> qualify</p>
     
<h4>Tips on prepared meals</h4>
<p>A mandatory tip or gratuity <strong>included as part of the bill</strong> amount to pay has the same tax status as the prepared meal. This kind of tip <strong>qualifies</strong> for GST/HST relief for the eligible period.</p>
<p>GST/HST does not apply to a tip or gratuity that is given freely by a customer to an employee of an eating establishment.</p>

<h4>Catering</h4>
<p>Catering service generally qualifies for GST/HST relief. The catering service must be for the provision, preparation and serving of food, non-alcoholic beverages or eligible alcoholic beverages to qualify. 
Other services that do not qualify for GST/HST relief include (but are not limited to):
	<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-lft-xl">
