    <h3 class="h4 mrgn-tp-0">References to trust accounts examinations</h3>
<p>The term trust accounts examinations refers to the examination of accounts of funds held in trust for the government, such as the <strong>GST/HST collected</strong> from customers.</p>

   
 </div> </div>
<p>Generally, GST/HST trust accounts examinations are done to make sure that the information you provided on your GST/HST returns is correct, complete and you have met all your collectible, remittance and reporting obligations under the Excise Tax Act. </p>
 
<details>
      <summary>Why are examinations important</summary>
<p>GST/HST trust accounts examinations promote regristrant awareness and understanding of their obligations under the Excise Tax Act, and its regulations, with the goal of increasing and enhancing voluntary compliance related to GST/HST. </p>
  <p>The purpose of these examinations is to maintain the integrity of the tax system with respect to <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The <strong>collecting, remitting and reporting</strong> of GST/HST</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The <strong>timely and accurate filing</strong> of GST/HST returns</li>
       <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The proper <strong>application of GST/HST rules</strong>, including input tax credits (ITCs), place-of-supply rules, and exemptions</li>    
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The correct <strong>registration status</strong> and use of business numbers</li>
		 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The appropriate <strong>classification of supplies</strong>, taxable, exempt, or zero-rated</li>
    </ul>	
  <p>Compliance with these obligations is achieved through a combination of <strong>GST/HST registrant education</strong> and <strong>responsible enforcement</strong>. </p>	
</details>

 <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm"></span><strong>Timeline:</strong> Generally, the <strong>full</strong> process is completed within 60 days</p>

      <summary>Using an <strong>authorized representative</strong></summary>
      <p>Even if a professional tax preparer completed your GST/HST returns on your behalf, <strong>you are responsible</strong> for making sure your business meets all its GST/HST obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your returns and remittance amounts, but they may not be aware of all the specific details or obligations that apply to your business. This is why the CRA may contact you directly for the review.</p>

     <p>If the CRA sends a letter to the authorized representative asking for information about one of their clients, the authorized representative <strong>must</strong> respond by the date mentioned in the letter.</p>
      <h4>If you choose to authorize a representative</h4>
      <p>You can use different methods to authorize a representative.</p>

		<p>Generally, the CRA officer will examine your books and records at your place of business. The CRA officer may also examine them at an alternate location (for example: your authorized representative’s office or the officer will borrow your documents to complete the examination at a CRA office).</p>

    <h4><span class="fas fa-user-shield fa-xl mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Confirm the visit is from the CRA authorized officer</h4>
  <p>If the CRA officer visits you (or your authorized representative), the CRA officer will identify themselves. Before providing any information: </p>
<ol>
<li>Tell the person you would like to first verify their identify</li>
<li>Request that they show their CRA authorization card (RC121A) to prove that they are a representative of the CRA (this card includes their <strong>name, photo and badge number</strong>)  </li> 
</ol>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md">If you <strong>doubt the visit is from a legitimate CRA officer</strong>, contact the CRA from the  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html#bsn-02">CRA's list of phone numbers</a> and ask an agent to confirm the officer's identity.</p>

<h4> <span class="far fa-calendar-alt mrgn-rght-sm"></span> When to provide the required documents</h4>
          <p>If your books and records are available electronically, the CRA officer may ask you to submit the documents online <strong>before or after meeting with you</strong>. This usually speeds up the examination process and leads to less time spent at your place of business.</p>

          <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
            <li class="cnjnctn-col">Examine the documents at your place of business or representative’s office.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>When the documents are returned, the CRA officer will request that you sign on the receipt acknowledging you received the books and records.</p>

          <p>If you no longer have the requested books and records, the CRA officer can assist you in finding alternate methods to confirm the amounts reported on your slips and summaries.

 <h4><span class="far fa-calendar-alt mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Paying a total amount owing</h4>
    <p>As the trust account examination reviewed payroll deductions and GST/HST collected that you did not remit by their due date, the total amount owing on the statement is past due and <strong>payable immediately</strong>.</p>
 
 <p>You are required to provide the payment in full for the balance owing to the CRA officer once you receive your statements of account.</p>

<p>If you are not able to pay the total amount owing, you may set up a payment arrangement with the CRA.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li><div id="ajax-step4d"> 	
<p>If an assessment is required, you will receive a <strong>notice of assessment (<abbr title="Notice of assessment">NOA</abbr>)</strong> separately with the balance owing. The notice will provide a summary of the breakdown of that balance, including any previous arrears balance, and any penalties or interest applied to overdue payments.</p>

  <div class="modal-body">
 <div id="ajax-account1">
<p>A GST/HST account is an account number assigned to a business who collects GST/HST registrant to identify themselves when dealing with the CRA.</p>
<div id="ajax-account2">
<p>This 15-character GST/HST account number contains the nine-digit <strong>business number (BN). </strong>The BN is a unique federal government numbering system that identifies your business and the various accounts you maintain. The GST/HST account number consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nine-digit BN</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Two-letter code </strong>for the type of program (for a GST/HST program, the letters are "<strong>RT</strong>") </li>
<li><strong>Four-digit reference number </strong>to identify each account in a program a business may have </li>
</ul>
<div id="ajax-account3">
<p>Depending on the type of business you have, you may need to register other types of program accounts or open a separate GST/HST account. The nine-digit business number will <strong>not change</strong>, but other letters or reference numbers will be added to the BN. </p>
<h4>Example </h4>
<p>A company requires a GST/HST, an import/export and two payroll accounts. The account numbers would be:</p>
