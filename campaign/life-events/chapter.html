  <h1 property="name">A first-time filer’s journey into taxes: Meet Jeff Baker</h1>
</hgroup>
<p><img src="https://placehold.co/150x150/#090909/white" alt="" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md img-circle pull-left mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md">For many students, university life is a juggling act. Between assignments, part-time jobs, and trying to stay on top of everything, the last thing on anyone’s mind is taxes. This is exactly the case for <strong class="nowrap">Jeff Baker</strong>, a 19-year-old undergraduate student who lives at home with his brother and parents.</p>
<p>Jeff’s days are filled with the usual daily chaos of lectures, studying, and pulling shifts at a local coffee shop to help cover his expenses.</p>
<p>He feels overwhelmed by the whole tax filing process. He doesn't know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If he needs to file </li>
  <li> What information he needs</li>
  <li>What happens if he makes a mistake</li>
</ul>
<!--<p>He lives at home with his parents and 15-year-old brother, Matt. </p>-->
<h2>Jeff discovers easy tax tutorials online</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>One evening, his younger brother mentions an online course he is taking at school. It is called "Learn about your taxes", and it offers  simple tutorials on how to do taxes.</p>
    <p>Later that night, Jeff checks it out. To his surprise, the course is clear, and beginner-friendly. It walks through the basics of taxes, including the key documents he needs. </p>
    <p>Learn more:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/educational-programs.html">Learn about your taxes</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4"> <img src="https://placehold.co/720x406/#090909/white" alt="" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md"> </div>
</div>
<h2>T4s aren’t so complicated</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>Jeff is still not sure what to do with the T4 slip from his coffee shop employers. Through the Learn about your taxes module, he learns that his T4 shows how much he earned and what taxes were deducted. These amounts need to be entered into his tax return which is due April 30 every year.</p>
    <p>He also learns that all tax documents should be saved for at least <strong>6 years</strong>, in case they’re ever needed for government review. He finds a sturdy box and starts an envelope with the tax year written on it. It feels very grown up! </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4"> <img src="https://placehold.co/720x406/#090909/white" alt="" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md"> </div>
</div>
<h2>Tips are taxable</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>Jeff has always treated his cash tips from the coffee shop as pocket money, and he doesn’t keep track of it. But now he realizes that those tips are taxable income and must be included in his tax return.</p>
    <p>Initially, this feels unfair—but the course explains how reporting all income could work in his favor. For example it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>helps increase his RRSP contribution room</li>
      <li>improves his standing for future loans or mortgages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reporting all his income also helps Jeff avoid penalties from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4"> <img src="https://placehold.co/720x406/#090909/white" alt="" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md"> </div>
</div>
<h2>Jeff files his taxes with confidence</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>It’s mid-April, and Jeff is sitting at his desk, filing his taxes electronically to meet the <strong>April 30th</strong> deadline.</p>
    <p>Now that he understands the process, Jeff knows that filing his income tax and benefit return is about more than just following the rules. It is a way to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Claim benefit and credit payments</li>
      <li>Get deductions that could lead to a refund or reduce taxes owed</li>
      <li>Access free tax-filing software designed for students and low-income individuals </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Realizing taxes aren't so tricky&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>Doing his taxes for the first time leaves Jeff feeling empowered — like he had taken a real step toward mastering adult life. And he isn’t keeping it to himself.</p>
    <p>He eagerly shares his newfound success on social media with friends. He even makes a new friend, a fellow student who has reached out to learn more about his experience – her name is Maryam.</p>
