		  <p>Involve relevant stakeholders at the beginning of the process, and identify the approvers early on. By getting early buy-in, showing the process, sharing the research, and demonstrating the rationale behind decisions, you can really speed up the entire process.</p>
<p>You will need to:</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li><h3>Co-design sessions to improve content</h3>
<p>Start with bringing the people who understand the subject matter together with the people who understand the struggles faced by users.</p></li>
<li><h3>Engage senior management early</h3>
<p>It’s hard to picture how something will look live on desktop, or on a phone, when you’re reviewing a document. Create working prototypes or prototypes that mimic what the end-result would be. This let you try out suggestions before putting a document with tracked changes into approvals.</p>

<p>Prototypes are a risk-reduction strategy and an excellent change management tool. They allow everyone reviewing them to experience what users will experience, and design accordingly. If you’re using interactive elements within some of your content, it’s much easier to understand how everything works together when you’re working from a prototype rather than a document.</p>

<p>A prototype also allows you to do usability testing before launch. You can see how your content works with users on desktop and on mobile. This will give you valuable data to support speedy approvals. Include your analysis and findings when you present your prototype to senior management.</p>

<p>
This will reinforce the message that decisions and changes to content and design should be driven by evidence.</p></li>
<li><h3>Create a prototype instead of a document</h3>
<p>It’s hard to picture how something will look live on desktop, or on a phone, when you’re reviewing a document.</p>

<li><h3>Offer live demos as part of the approval process</h3>
<p>Gathering all the approvers together for a demonstration session to go through a prototype and how it addresses user needs can significantly simplify the approval process. Use the prototype to show what the content looks like both on desktop and mobile, and explain why the design decisions were made.</p></li>
<li><h3>Recognize change isn’t easy</h3>
<p>As with any change, it may take time and persistence before your team is using this approach regularly. Approvers and senior managers can’t be available for all working sessions or for all content. You need to know when to pull them in to make the best use of their limited time. Focus on high visibility content, content related to top tasks for your audience, and content that involves multiple internal groups or multiple departments.</p></li>
