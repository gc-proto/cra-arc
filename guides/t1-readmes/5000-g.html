    <ul>
      <li>On&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">December 31</span>,&nbsp;2023, you were living outside Canada, you were not considered to be a factual resident of Canada because you did not have significant residential ties in Canada, and you were a government employee, a member of the Canadian Forces including their overseas school staff, or working under a Global Affairs Canada assistance program. This can also apply to the family members of an individual who was in one of these situations</li>
      <li>You stayed in Canada for&nbsp;<strong><span class="nowrap">183 days</span>&nbsp;or more</strong>&nbsp;in the tax year, do <strong>not </strong>have significant residential ties with Canada, and are <strong>not </strong>considered a resident of another country under the terms of a tax treaty between Canada and that country</li>

    <h4 id="NonResident">Non-residents</h4>
    <p>You are a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> for tax purposes if one of the following applies:</p>

      <li>You normally live in another country&nbsp;and&nbsp;are <strong>not </strong>considered to be a factual resident of Canada</li>
      <li>You do <strong>not </strong>have significant residential ties in Canada and one of the following applies:<br>

    <ul>

You must also file a <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/citizens/income-tax-return/"><span class="nowrap">Revenu Québec</span> Income Tax Return</a></li>
      <li>If you are filing a return for a person who died <span class="nowrap">in 2023</span>, use the income tax package for the province or territory where that person resided at the time of death</li>
      <li>If you emigrated from Canada <span class="nowrap">in 2023</span>, use the income tax package for the province or territory where you resided on the day you left Canada</li>
      <li>If you had residential ties in <strong>more than one</strong> province or territory on <span class="nowrap">December 31</span>, 2023, use the income tax package for the province or territory where you had your <strong>most important</strong> residential ties (for example, if you usually reside in Ontario but were going to school in Alberta or Quebec, use the income tax package for Ontario)</li>
      <li>If you resided outside Canada on <span class="nowrap">December 31</span>, 2023, but kept significant residential ties with Canada, you may be considered a <strong>factual resident</strong> of Canada.

    <h3 id="PenaltiesandInterest">Penalties and interest<br>
    </h3>
    <h4 id="Penalites">Penalties</h4>
    <p>The CRA may charge you a penalty if any of the following applies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You filed your return late and you owe tax <span class="nowrap">for 2023</span></li>
      <li>You failed to report an amount&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">on&nbsp;your 2023</span>&nbsp;return&nbsp;<strong>and</strong> you also failed to report an amount on your return for 2020, 2021 or 2022</li>
      <li>You knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, made a false statement or an omission on your <span class="nowrap">2023 return</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="InterestPay">Interest on your balance owing</h4>
    <p>If you have a balance owing <span class="nowrap">for 2023</span>, the CRA will charge compound daily interest starting <span class="nowrap">May 1,</span> 2024, on any unpaid amount owing <span class="nowrap">for 2023</span>. This includes any balance owing if the CRA reassesses your return.</p>
    <h4 id="InterestPaid">Interest on your refund</h4>
    <p>The CRA will pay you compound daily interest on your tax refund <span class="nowrap">for 2023</span>&nbsp;in some situations. The calculation will start on the latest of the following three dates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="nowrap">May 30</span>, 2024</li>
      <li>the <span class="nowrap">30th day</span> after you file your return</li>
      <li>the day you overpaid your taxes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="CancelOrWaive">Cancel or waive penalties and interest</h4>
    <p>The CRA administers legislation, commonly called taxpayer relief provisions, that allows the CRA the discretion to cancel or waive penalties and interest when taxpayers cannot meet their tax obligations due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>
    <p>The CRA’s discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ends within <strong><span class="nowrap">10 calendar</span></strong> years before the year in which a relief request is made.</p>
    <p>For penalties, the CRA will consider your request only if it relates to a tax year or fiscal period ending in any of the <span class="nowrap"><strong>1</strong></span><strong><span class="nowrap">0 calendar</span> years before</strong> the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made <span class="nowrap">in 2023</span>&nbsp;must relate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending <span class="nowrap">in 2013</span>&nbsp;or later.</p>
    <p>For interest on a balance owing for any tax year or fiscal period, the CRA will consider only the amounts that accrued during the&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">10 calendar</span>&nbsp;years before&nbsp;the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made <span class="nowrap">in 2023</span> must relate to interest that accrued&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">in 2013</span>&nbsp;or later.</p>
    <p>Taxpayer relief requests can be made online using the CRA’s My Account, My Business Account (MyBA) or Represent a Client digital services.</p>
    <p>You can also fill out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form <span class="nowrap">RC4288</span>, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties and Interest</a>, and send it to the CRA online using My Account, My Business Account or Represent a Client or by mail to the designated office shown on the last page of Form RC4288.</p>

    <h3>Tax reviews</h3>
    <p>When the CRA receives your return, it is usually processed and a notice of assessment is sent to you. However, each year, the CRA conducts a number of reviews to promote awareness of, and compliance with, the laws that the CRA administers.</p>
    <p>If your return is selected for a more detailed review before or after it is assessed, you will receive a letter or phone call from the CRA. It’s important to know that a review is not a tax audit. In most cases, it’s simply a routine check to ensure that the information that you provided on your return is correct.</p>
    <p>If you receive a request from the CRA asking for documents or receipts, you should reply within the timeframe given. Make sure to include all of the information that the CRA asks for and that the copies of your documents are clear and easy to read.</p>
    <p>Remember that the CRA is here to help you. If you cannot get the documents that the CRA is asking for, have questions, or need more time to reply, let the CRA know. If you do not reply to the CRA’s request, the CRA may adjust your return and your claim or deduction may be disallowed.</p>

    <h3 id="HowToChangeAReturn">How to change a return</h3>
    <p>If you have more information that could change the result of a return that you have already sent to the CRA, do <strong>not</strong> file another return for that year. Wait until you receive your notice of assessment before asking for changes.</p>
    <p>Generally, you can only request a change to a return for a tax year ending in any of the <span class="nowrap">10 previous</span> calendar years. For example, a request made in 2024 must relate to a tax year <span class="nowrap">after 2013</span>&nbsp;to be considered.</p>
    <p>You can change your return in any of the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>using the ReFILE service if your return was filed electronically using a certified software.
