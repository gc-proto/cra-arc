                <h2 id="toc0">When to expect your refund</h2>
                <p>You can claim a refund if your net tax (<strong><span class="nowrap">line 109</span></strong> of your GST/HST return) for a reporting period is a negative amount.</p>
                <p>Generally, the CRA process a GST/HST return in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2 weeks</strong> if you filed electronically</li>
                    <li><strong>4 weeks</strong> if you filed a paper return</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you did <strong>not</strong> include all the necessary information but completed your return correctly, the processing of your refund could be delayed.</p>
                <p>The CRA will hold any GST/HST refund or rebate you are entitled to until all outstanding returns and amounts are received. This includes all amounts payable and returns required under other programs administered by the CRA. The CRA can also use any GST/HST refund or rebate that you are entitled to receive to pay that outstanding amount.</p>
                <p>You may receive your refund deposited directly into your bank account. For more information on how to enroll for direct deposit, go to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">Direct deposit – Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</p>
                <p>The CRA pay refund interest according to the <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a>. Refund interest is compounded daily on an overpayment up to and including the day the overpayment is refunded, repaid, or applied. The calculation of interest we pay <strong><sup></sup>ends </strong>on the day the refund is paid or applied.</p>

                <p>To make sure you reported certain amounts correctly on your GST/HST return, CRA may contact you for a GST/HST post-assessment review. This is not a GST/HST audit.</p>
                <p>During this review, the CRA will ask you to provide a brief explanation to validate the amounts on your GST/HST return. In some cases, you may be asked to provide supporting documents for these amounts such as receipts or a bill of sale. Adjustments may be made to your GST/HST return, if required.</p>
                <p>There are some common adjustments that are made to correct reporting errors on GST/HST returns.
