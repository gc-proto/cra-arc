                <p>Usually, you must keep your records for&nbsp;six years&nbsp;from the end of the year to which they relate. This includes all sales and purchase invoices, and all other records related to your business operations and the GST/HST. However, the CRA may ask you to keep the invoices longer than six years. If you want to destroy your records earlier, you have to send the CRA a written request and wait for the written approval.</p>
                <p>For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/15-1.html">GST/HST Memorandum 15.1, General Requirements for Books and Records</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As a registrant, you also need the correct information on the invoices you&nbsp;<strong>get</strong>&nbsp;from your suppliers to support your ITC claims.</p>
