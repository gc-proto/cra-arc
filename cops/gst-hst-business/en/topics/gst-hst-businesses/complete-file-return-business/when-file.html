            <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) can charge <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-penalties-interest.html">penalties and interest</a> on any returns or amounts we have not received by the due date. The CRA will hold any GST/HST refund or rebate you are entitled to until the CRA receives all outstanding returns and amounts. If you are a sole proprietor or partnership, your personal income tax refund will also be held. If you are <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/account-close.html">closing a GST/HST account</a>, you must file a final return.</p>

            <p>Reporting periods are the periods of time for which you file your GST/HST returns.</p>
            <p>Generally, your reporting period is determined based on the total revenue from your taxable supplies of property and services made in Canada in your previous fiscal year or in each fiscal quarter leading up to it. The revenue includes zero-rated supplies of property and services made in Canada, and those of your associates.</p>
