    <h3 id="most">How to calculate your net tax for most businesses</h3>
    <p>For most businesses, this calculation is straightforward. Generally, with the regular method, the <span class="nowrap">GST/HST</span> is calculated on every supply of a taxable property or service (other than <span class="nowrap">zero-rated</span> supplies, which are taxable <span class="nowrap">at 0%</span>). However, to help reduce paperwork and bookkeeping costs, most small businesses can use the quick method of accounting to calculate their <span class="nowrap">GST/HST</span> net tax remittance (payment). Under the quick method, the <span class="nowrap">GST/HST</span> paid or payable is calculated based on a percentage.</p>

                <h4 id="regular">Regular method</h4>
                <p>You have to calculate your net tax for each GST/HST reporting period and report this amount on your GST/HST return. To do so, calculate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the GST/HST collected or that became collectible by you on your taxable supplies made during the reporting period</li>
                    <li>the GST/HST paid and payable on your business purchases and expenses for which you can claim an input tax credit (ITC)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The difference between these two amounts, including any adjustments, is your net tax. For help calculating the net tax and filling out your GST/HST return using the regular method, see:</p>

                    <p>During your last reporting period, you collected <span class="nowrap">$1,000</span> of GST/HST from your clients.

                    <p>Total: $25,000</p>
                    <p>GST collected ($25,000 × 5%): $1,250</p>

                    <p>GST paid on purchases and expenses ($21,700 × 5%) = $1,085</p>
                    <p><strong>Net tax calculation for charities</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                    <p>Enter $750 on <strong><span class="nowrap">line 103</span></strong> (60% of the $1,250 GST collected).</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                    <p>You can claim ITCs for the GST you paid for the ventilation system (improvement to real property) and for the computer equipment (capital property purchase) that you intend to use <strong>more <span class="nowrap">than 50%</span></strong> in your commercial activities.</p>
                    <p>ITC  5% × ($9,200 + $2,000) = $560</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Subtract </strong>your total in Step 2 from your total in Step 1. This equals your net tax before any rebates.</p>
                    <p>Net tax $750 – $560 = $190</p>
                    <p>Enter this amount on <strong><span class="nowrap">line 109</span></strong>.</p>
                    <p>You would also be entitled to claim a PSB rebate for the <strong>remaining </strong>GST/HST paid.</p>
