                    <p>Some businesses use accounting periods that are different from calendar months or quarters for tax reporting purposes.</p>
                    <p>If your business wants to use accounting periods instead of calendar months or quarters to file GST/HST returns, you need to get approval from the CRA before the first day of each fiscal year to which the accounting periods relate. To do this, use our digital services at <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> or <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>, or send <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst71.html">Form GST71, Notification of GST/HST Accounting Periods</a>, or a written request before the beginning of each fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>If you are a <strong>selected listed financial institution</strong> for GST/HST or QST purposes or both and you want to notify the CRA of your business’s accounting periods, or to request approval to use fiscal months that are not within standard guidelines for GST/HST and QST purposes, fill out <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc7271.html">Form RC7271, Notification of GST/HST Accounting Periods for Selected Listed Financial Institutions</a>.</p>
                    <p>Usually, your accounting periods have to meet the following guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each fiscal month has to be shorter than <span class="nowrap">36 days</span> and, except for the first and the last month in a fiscal quarter, longer than <span class="nowrap">27 days</span>. You can apply to have one fiscal month per quarter that is longer than <span class="nowrap">35 days</span>. You can also apply to have fiscal months, other than the first or last month of the quarter, that are shorter than <span class="nowrap">28 days</span></li>
                        <li>A fiscal quarter has to be shorter than <span class="nowrap">120 days</span> and, except for the first and last fiscal quarters in the fiscal year, longer than <span class="nowrap">83 days</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you do not notify the CRA of your accounting periods, the CRA will assign calendar months and <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4022/general-information-gst-hst-registrants.html#D_102">calendar quarters</a>, and you will have to wait until your next fiscal year to have the option to choose your accounting periods.</p>
