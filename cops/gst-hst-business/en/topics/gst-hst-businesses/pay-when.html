    <h2>When to remit (pay) the GST/HST</h2>
    <p>Your payment deadline depends on your GST/HST filing period. Most GST/HST payments are due at the same time as your GST/HST returns. Your payment deadline is <strong>different</strong> than your filing deadline if you are <strong>either</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an annual filer and have to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/pay-instalment.html">remit (pay) the GST/HST by instalments</a></li>
        <li>an individual who is an annual filer with a December 31 fiscal year-end and has business income for tax purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must remit (pay) the GST/HST for any invoice you include in your return, even if you have not yet been paid. For more information, see <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-calculate-net-tax.html#whtncldrtrn">What to include in your return</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="deadline">GST/HST payment and filing deadlines</h3>
    <p>If you are filing a personalized GST/HST return, the due date is located at the top of your GST34-2, GST/HST Return for Registrants. If your due date is a <strong>Saturday</strong>, <strong>Sunday</strong> or <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday</a> recognized by the CRA, your payment is on time if we receive it on the <strong>next business day</strong>.</p>
