                    <p>In a merger, one corporation absorbs one or more corporations and continues to carry on business as usual. An amalgamation takes place when two or more corporations known as predecessor corporations, combine their businesses to form a new successor corporation.

                    <p>In some cases, the newly amalgamated corporation can keep the BN and the GST/HST account number of the dominant predecessor.</p>

                    <p>When the sole proprietor of the business has passed away, the individual’s date of death should be provided to the CRA as soon as possible by contacting your tax service office or calling <span class="nowrap"><strong>1-800-959-5525</strong>.</span></p>
                    <p>If the commercial activity of the individual has subsequently ceased, the GST/HST account has to be closed and a final GST/HST return will have to be filed for a reporting period that ends on the day the individual died. The due date of the return is one month after the end of the reporting period.</p>
                    <p>However, in cases where tax becomes payable or remittable by the individual’s estate, the GST/HST account has to remain open until all obligations under the estate are satisfied. A reporting period that includes the day the individual died is separated into two reporting periods.</p>
                    <p>Generally, two returns have to be filed as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a return for a reporting period that ends on the day the individual died</li>
                        <li>a second return for a reporting period of the estate that begins on the next day after the individual died and ends on the day the reporting period would have ended if the individual had not died</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For both of these reporting periods, the due date of the return is <strong>one month</strong> after the end of the reporting period.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 1<br></strong>The individual is a quarterly filer with a reporting period of January 1 to <span class="nowrap">March 31, 2022</span>. The individual passed away on <span class="nowrap">February 14, 2022</span> and the GST/HST account is subsequently closed. Send the CRA a final return for the period January 1 to <span class="nowrap">February 14, 2022</span>, which is due <span class="nowrap">March 14, 2022</span>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 2<br></strong>The individual is an annual filer with a reporting period of January 1 to <span class="nowrap">December 31, 2022</span>. The individual passed away on <span class="nowrap">September 15, 2022</span>. The individual’s estate has tax to remit and continues to use the current GST/HST account. Send the CRA:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a return for the period of <span class="nowrap">January 1</span> to <span class="nowrap">September 15, 2022</span>, which is due <span class="nowrap">October 15, 2022</span></li>
                        <li>a second return for the period of <span class="nowrap">September 16</span> to <span class="nowrap">December 31, 2022</span>, which is due <span class="nowrap">January 31, 2023</span></li>
