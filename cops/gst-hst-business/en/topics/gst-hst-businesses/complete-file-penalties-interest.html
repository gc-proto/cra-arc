    <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) charges interest if you make late or insufficient payments. Depending on the debt, the interest charged is either&nbsp;<strong>arrears interest </strong>or<strong> instalment interest</strong>.</p>
    <p>The CRA pays interest on&nbsp;an <strong>overpayment or refund</strong> of net tax claimed on a GST/HST return.&nbsp;</p>

        <li>any other overdue GST/HST amount that you have to remit to the Receiver General</li>

    <h3 id="instalment">Instalment interest</h3>
    <p>If the instalment payments you make are equal to one quarter of your net tax from your last fiscal year and you make those payments in full and on time, the CRA will not charge instalment interest, even if your net tax for the year is more than the instalments you made.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Interest on the part of any instalment payment that was not paid or that was paid late will be charged <strong>at the end</strong> of the fiscal year.</p>
    <p>If you realize at any time during the fiscal year that you paid less than your required instalment payment or that you did not pay an instalment on time, you can reduce or eliminate your instalment interest by overpaying your next instalment payment or by paying it early.</p>
