        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>GST/HST Internet File Transfer is an online service provided by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) that allows eligible businesses to file their GST/HST returns directly over the Internet. It leverages third-party accounting <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-ift-software.html">software</a> to simplify the process and uses a four-digit <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-access-codes.html">access code</a> for authentication.</p>
          <p>This service provides many advantages:</p>
          <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It meets the mandatory electronic filing requirement</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is free to use</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is available seven days a week</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is fast and easy, secure and confidential</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It provides immediate confirmation that the CRA has received your return</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It reduces processing time</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It speeds up refunds (especially when combined with <a href="#">direct deposit</a>)</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It eliminates the need to mail paper returns</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>Using CRA-approved software, eligible registrants generate and save an electronic version of their GST/HST return. Access the service through the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-internet-file-transfer/gst-hst-internet-file-transfer-ready-file.html">Ready to file</a> page and attach your (.tax) file. Once you have attached the file, you should ensure that your return is correct, complete and accurate. If you wish to file the information as your return, confirm that you want to file the information as your return by selecting "yes" to the declaration.</p>
          <p>We will do a preliminary check of your return. If your return meets the basic requirements, you'll receive your confirmation number. <strong>This means that your tax return has been accepted for processing.</strong> Keep this confirmation number for your records.</p>
          <p>If there are any problems with the electronic tax return you tried to send us, we'll send you an explanation of errors or corrections needed. <strong>This means your tax return was not accepted for processing</strong>. You should save, print, or make note of all messages we send. Before trying to retransmit the return, you must make the appropriate corrections within your software according to the error messages you received and re-save your file.</p>
          <h2 id="lgblty">Eligibility</h2>
          <p>GST/HST Internet File Transfer is available to most GST/HST registrants, <strong>excluding</strong> those with accounts that are administered by Revenu Québec. If you are a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) that reports both the GST/HST and QST, you must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-which-rate/financial-institutions.html#rqfl">determine which returns to complete and when to file</a>.</p>
          <p>The following registrants are <strong>not eligible</strong> to use GST/HST Internet File Transfer and must use an alternate filing method:</p>
          <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants whose accounts are administered by Revenu Québec</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Builders required to report transitional information on housing (Schedule A of the GST/HST return)
              <ul>
                <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants required to recapture input tax credits for the provincial portion of the HST on specified property or services (Schedules B and C of the GST/HST return)
              <ul>
                <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE or file through a participating financial institution that offers electronic filing for GST/HST returns</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Security and confidentiality</h2>
          <p>The CRA limits access to browsers supporting Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a protocol that provides authentication, confidentially, and data integrity between communicating applications. Using the appropriate safeguards and configuration, TLS provides a method of transmitting data securely across networks. Effective implementation of TLS will assist in mitigating the most serious threats with web-based applications such as eavesdropping, data tampering, and message forgery. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">Upgrade to TLS 1.2</a> so that your system is as secure as possible.</p>
          <h2>Before you start</h2>
          <p>Before using GST/HST Internet File transfer, ensure you meet the following requirements:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You are <a href="lgblty">eligible</a> to use GST/HST Internet File transfer</li>

              <ul>

          <h2>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts can use GST/HST Internet File transfer. However, after filing your return, you must mail <span class="nowrap">Form GST 499-1</span> (the corresponding FNT schedule) to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-centres.html#summ">Atlantic Tax Centre</a>.</p>
          <h2>Changing a return already filed <br>
            <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>Returns can only be adjusted electronically using the My Business Account (MyBA) portal. If you do not already have a MyBA user ID and password, you can create one at <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>.</p>
          <p>If you are not registered with MyBA, send your adjustment request, in writing, to your tax centre.</p>
          <h2>Filing a return with a rebate <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>You can file returns with a rebate amount on line 111 using GST/HST Internet File Transfer. However, you must also mail the rebate application forms to the relevant tax centre on or before the due date of your return.</p>
          <h2>Authorized accountants may use Internet File transfer (also mentioned in access code page) <br>
            <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>If your accountant is legally authorized to sign the paper copy of your GST/HST return, they can use GST/HST TELEFILE to file your return on your behalf. They will need to use <strong>your</strong> GST/HST <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-access-codes.html">access code</a>. If your accountant is not authorized to file GST/HST returns on your behalf, you can sign up for My Business Account and add your accountant as an authorized representative.</p>
          <h2>Joint filers <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>If you are the coordinator of a closely related group of corporations (i.e. you have filed election GST303) and you file returns electronically, you must still send your letter of direction to your tax centre.</p>
          <h2 id="rtn_dcmnts">Retaining supporting documents <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, keep all supporting documents for six years, as the CRA may contact you for more information after they process your return.</p>
          <p>You should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
