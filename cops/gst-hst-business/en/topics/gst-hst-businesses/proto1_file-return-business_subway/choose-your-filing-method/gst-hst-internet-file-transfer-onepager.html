          <p>GST/HST Internet File Transfer is an online service provided by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) that allows eligible businesses to file their GST/HST returns directly over the Internet. It leverages third-party accounting <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-ift-software.html">software</a> to simplify the process. This service provides many advantages:</p>
          <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It meets the mandatory electronic filing requirement</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is free to use</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is available seven days a week</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is fast and easy, secure and confidential</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It provides immediate confirmation that the CRA has received your return</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It reduces processing time</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It speeds up refunds (especially when combined with <a href="#">direct deposit</a>)</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It eliminates the need to mail paper returns</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>The process begins with generating an electronic version of your GST/HST return using CRA-approved <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-ift-software.html">software</a>. This software creates a specific file format with a &quot;.tax&quot; extension. You then access the GST/HST Internet File Transfer service through the CRA website's &quot;Ready to file&quot; page. After attaching your &quot;.tax&quot; file, you review and confirm its accuracy before submitting it to the CRA. The CRA conducts a preliminary check of your return. A confirmation number indicates your return has been accepted for processing. Alternatively, the CRA will send an explanation of any errors requiring correction. You must retain this confirmation number for your records.</p>
          <p>A four-digit <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-access-codes.html">access code</a> is essential for using GST/HST Internet File Transfer.</p>
          <h2>Eligibility</h2>
          <p>GST/HST Internet File Transfer is available to most GST/HST registrants, <strong>excluding</strong> those with accounts that are administered by Revenu Québec. If you are a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) that reports both the GST/HST and QST, you must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-which-rate/financial-institutions.html#rqfl">determine which returns to complete and when to file</a>.</p>
          <p>The following registrants are <strong>not eligible</strong> to use GST/HST Internet File Transfer and must use an alternate filing method:</p>
          <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants whose accounts are administered by Revenu Québec</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Builders required to report transitional information on housing (Schedule A of the GST/HST return)
              <ul>
                <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants required to recapture input tax credits for the provincial portion of the HST on specified property or services (Schedules B and C of the GST/HST return)
              <ul>
                <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE or file through a participating financial institution that offers electronic filing for GST/HST returns</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Security and confidentiality</h2>
          <p>The CRA limits access to browsers supporting Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a protocol that provides authentication, confidentially, and data integrity between communicating applications. Using the appropriate safeguards and configuration, TLS provides a method of transmitting data securely across networks. Effective implementation of TLS will assist in mitigating the most serious threats with web-based applications such as eavesdropping, data tampering, and message forgery. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">Upgrade to TLS 1.2</a> so that your system is as secure as possible.</p>
          <h2>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts can use GST/HST TELEFILE. However, after filing your return, you must mail <span class="nowrap">Form GST 499-1</span> (the corresponding FNT schedule) to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-centres.html#summ">Atlantic Tax Centre</a>.</p>
          <h2>Filing a return with a rebate <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>You can file returns with a rebate amount on line 111 using GST/HST Internet File Transfer. However, you must also mail the rebate application forms to the relevant tax centre on or before the due date of your return.</p>
          <h2>Joint filers <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>If you are the coordinator of a closely related group of corporations (i.e. you have filed election GST303) and you file returns electronically, you must still send your letter of direction to your tax centre.</p>
          <h2>Retaining supporting documents <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, keep all supporting documents for six years, as the CRA may contact you for more information after they process your return.</p>
          <p>You should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
