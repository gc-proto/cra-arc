          <p>GST/HST TELEFILE is a service that allows qualifying registrants to file their GST/HST returns directly to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) over the internet using their touch-tone telephone. This automated service provides many advantages:</p>

            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is free to use</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is available seven days a week</li>

            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It reduces processing time</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It speeds up refunds (especially when combined with <a href="#">direct deposit</a>)</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It eliminates the need to mail paper returns</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Eligibility</h2>
          <p>GST/HST TELEFILE is available to GST/HST registrants across Canada and the United States, <strong>excluding</strong> those with accounts administered by Revenu Québec.</p>
          <p>The following registrants are <strong>not eligible</strong> to use GST/HST TELEFILE and must use an alternate filing method:</p>
          <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants whose accounts are administered by Revenu Québec</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Builders required to report transitional information on housing (Schedule A of the GST/HST return)
              <ul>
                <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants required to recapture input tax credits for the provincial portion of the HST on specified property or services (Schedules B and C of the GST/HST return)
              <ul>
                <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE or file through a participating financial institution that offers electronic filing for GST/HST returns</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) that reports both the GST/HST and QST, you must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-which-rate/financial-institutions.html#rqfl">determine which returns to complete and when to file</a>.</p>
          <h2>Before you start</h2>
          <p>Before using GST/HST TELEFILE, complete the following steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Ensure you have a touch-tone phone</li>
            <li>Verify that you are <a href="#">eligible</a> to use GST/HST TELEFILE</li>
            <li>Ensure you have a four-digit <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-access-codes.html">access code</a></li>
            <li>Prepare your return information in Canadian funds</li>
            <li>If you have an amount owing, find out how to make a payment to the CRA</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Using the service</h2>
          <ol start="5" class="lst-stps ld-zr">
            <li>To use GST/HST TELEFILE to file your return, dial the toll-free telephone number <strong>1-800-959-2038</strong>. An automated system will guide you through the process. The system will ask you to enter your tax information using your telephone keypad.
              <ul>
                <li>Enter all the digits of your Business Number, but do not enter the letters &quot;RT&quot;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use the following keys on your touch-tone phone to make selections during the filing process:
              <ul>
                <li>Press &quot;*&quot; to have a message repeated.</li>
                <li>Press &quot;1&quot; to answer yes or &quot;0&quot; to answer no.</li>
                <li>Press &quot;#&quot; when you have finished entering an amount.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The GST/HST TELEFILE system repeats each entry to help you file an accurate return. Make any necessary corrections before you confirm your amounts.</li>
            <li>Once the data has been entered, you will be asked to confirm that the information you entered is correct. If you answer yes, the <strong>CRA will consider your return received</strong>.
              <ul>
                <li>If you hang up at any time before confirming that you want to file your return, the information you entered will not be saved. You can hang up and call again up to a maximum of six times.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The automated system will immediately issue you a six-digit confirmation number. Write down your confirmation number and keep it with your records. Your return will then begin processing.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Filing a return with a rebate amount <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>You can file returns with a rebate amount on line 111 using GST/HST TELEFILE. However, you must also mail the rebate application forms to the relevant tax centre on or before the due date of your return.</p>
          <h2>Filing a return with an amount owing</h2>
          <p>You can file a return with an amount owing using GST/HST TELEFILE. Find out about <a href="#">payment options</a> on the CRA website.</p>
          <h2>Authorized accountants may use TELEFILE (also mentioned in access code page)</h2>
          <p>If your accountant is legally authorized to sign the paper copy of your GST/HST return, they can use GST/HST TELEFILE to file your return on your behalf. They will need to use <strong>your</strong> GST/HST <a href="#">access code</a>. If your accountant is not authorized to file GST/HST returns on your behalf, you can sign up for My Business Account and add your accountant as an authorized representative.</p>
          <h2>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts can use GST/HST TELEFILE. However, after filing your return, you must mail <span class="nowrap">Form GST 499-1</span> (the corresponding FNT schedule) to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-centres.html#summ">Atlantic Tax Centre</a>.</p>
          <h2>Changing a return already filed</h2>
          <p>Returns can only be adjusted electronically using the My Business Account (MyBA) portal. If you do not already have a MyBA user ID and password, you can request one on the CRA website. If you are not registered with MyBA, send your adjustment request in writing to your tax centre.</p>
          <h2>Joint filers <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>If you are the coordinator of a closely related group of corporations (i.e. you have filed election GST303) and you file returns electronically, you must still send your letter of direction to your tax centre.</p>
          <h2>Retaining supporting documents <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
          <p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, keep all supporting documents for six years, as the CRA may contact you for more information after they process your return.</p>
          <p>You should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
