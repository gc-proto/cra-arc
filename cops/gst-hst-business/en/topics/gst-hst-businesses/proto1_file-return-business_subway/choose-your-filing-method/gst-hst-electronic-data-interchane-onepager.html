      <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">GST/HST Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</h1>
      <p>EDI is a computer-to-computer exchange of information in a standard format. You can use EDI to file the electronic equivalent of Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>, Schedule B for the recapture of input tax credits, and Schedule C for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits. You can also pay the net tax you owe electronically through a participating Canadian financial institution.</p>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You need to register with a participating financial institution.</li>
        <li>You can then provide the necessary GST/HST return and payment information to them through your computer, by phone, or any other mutually agreeable method.</li>
        <li>The financial institution converts the information into an electronic GST/HST return and/or payment that meets the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)'s specifications and transmits the return and/or payment to the CRA.</li>
        <li>Some financial institutions may charge a fee for this service.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Benefits of using EDI</h2>
      <p>There are advantages to filing your return using EDI whether you are receiving a refund or making a payment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy&nbsp;</strong>- you key in the information, eliminating transcription errors from further handling</li>
        <li><strong>Cash flow control&nbsp;</strong>- transfer of funds is guaranteed on the value date you establish with your financial institution</li>
        <li><strong>Quicker refund payments&nbsp;</strong>- your GST/HST refund can be <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">deposited directly</a> into your account within 10-15 calendar days</li>
        <li><strong>Convenience&nbsp;</strong>- EDI ends the need to mail a return</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>GST/HST EDI is available to GST/HST registrants across Canada, excluding those that are administered by Revenu Québec. If you are a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) that reports both the GST/HST and QST, please visit <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-which-rate/financial-institutions.html#rqfl">Determine which returns to complete and when to file</a>.</p>
      <h3>Builders - transitional information </h3>
      <p>If you are a builder required to report transitional information on housing (Schedule A of the GST/HST return), you must file your return using <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-netfile.html">GST/HST NETFILE</a>.</p>
      <h3>Filing a return with a rebate amount <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h3>
      <p>You can file returns with a rebate amount on line 111 using GST/HST EDI. However, you must also mail the rebate application form(s) to the relevant tax centre on or before the due date of your return.</p>
      <h3>Recaptured input tax credits</h3>
      <p>GST/HST EDI can be used to file returns with Schedule B (recapture of input tax credits) and Schedule C (reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits). Contact your financial institution to see if they offer these filing options.</p>
      <h2>Non-residents filing GST/HST returns</h2>
      <p>Non-residents can file their GST/HST returns using EDI. However, they must complete all GST/HST amounts in Canadian dollars and remit Canadian funds to the CRA using a participating financial institution in Canada.</p>
      <h2 id="rtn_dcmnts">Retaining supporting documents <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
      <p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, keep all supporting documents for six years, as the CRA may contact you for more information after they process your return.</p>
      <p>You should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
      <h2>Joint filers <br>
        <small>(Common section - move to choose method page?)</small></h2>
      <p>If you are the coordinator of a closely related group of corporations (i.e. you have filed election GST303) and you file returns electronically, you must still send your letter of direction to your tax centre.</p>
