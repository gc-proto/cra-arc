It also includes packing materials used in packing other goods, but does not include goods or software added to any property that is not held for sale by the person. With the use of a valid Export Distribution Centre certificate, a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#registrant">registrant</a> is entitled to import, or acquire in Canada, property for use or supply as &quot;added property&quot; without having to pay the GST/HST.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Alcoholic beverages</h2>
    <div id="alcohol">

        <ul>
            <li>beer, ale, stout, porter, or malt liquor containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume</li>
            <li>wine containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Generally, when we refer to alcohol, we mean ethyl alcohol.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>All-inclusive price</h2>
    <div id="allinclusive">
        <p><strong>All-inclusive price</strong> generally means a single price for all property and services sold together in a package. However, in the tourism industry, sometimes prices for certain <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#property">property</a> or <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#services">services</a> that are included in a tour package are listed on an invoice for information purposes. The Canada Revenue Agency accepts that such packages are sold for an all-inclusive price.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Allowance</h2>
    <div id="allowance">
        <p><strong>Allowance</strong> means any payment, periodic or otherwise, which a member of a partnership receives from the partnership, in addition to their partnership income, without having to account for its use. A reasonable allowance is not included in the partnership member's income for income tax purposes. For example, an allowance for a motor vehicle is not usually included in the partnership member's income when it is based solely on a reasonable per-kilometre rate.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ancillary">
        <p><strong>Ancillary supply</strong>, for the purposes of the public service bodies' rebate, means an exempt supply of property or a service for which an amount (other than a nominal amount) is paid or payable to the supplier as medical funding. In addition, to be an ancillary supply, <strong>one</strong> of the following conditions must be met:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
            <li class="cnjnctn-col">The payment is for a service of organizing or coordinating the making of facility supplies or home medical supplies</li>
            <li class="cnjnctn-col">The payment is for the part of property or a service (other than a financial service) used to make a facility supply, however, the supply cannot be a home medical supply or a facility supply itself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of supplies that could be ancillary supplies are laboratory and diagnostic services, centralized laundry services, and in-patient meal services.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Arm's length</h2>
    <div id="armslength">
        <p><strong>Arm's length</strong> generally refers to a relationship or a transaction between persons who act in their separate interests. An arm's length transaction is generally a transaction that reflects ordinary commercial dealings between parties acting in their separate interests.</p>
        <p>&quot;Related persons&quot; are not considered to deal with each other at arm's length. Related persons include individuals connected by blood relationship, marriage, common-law partnership, legal adoption or adoption in fact. A corporation and another person or two corporations may also be related persons. In addition, for GST/HST purposes, a member of a partnership is related to the partnership.</p>
        <p>&quot;Unrelated persons&quot; may not be dealing with each other at arm's length at a particular time. Each case will depend upon its own facts. The following factors are useful criteria that will be considered in determining whether parties are not dealing at arm's length:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>whether there is a common mind that directs the bargaining for both parties to a transaction</li>
            <li>whether the parties to a transaction act in concert without separate interests; &quot;acting in concert&quot; means, for example, that parties act with considerable interdependence on a transaction of common interest</li>
            <li>whether there is de facto control (that is, effective without legal control) of one party by the other because of, for example, advantage, authority, or influence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-5-transfer-income-property-rights-third-parties/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">Income Tax Folio S1‑F5‑C1, Related persons and dealing at arm's length</a>.</p>

    <h2>Associated person</h2>
    <div id="associate">
        <p><strong>Associated person</strong>, for <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#gst">GST/HST</a> purposes, means a person that is generally associated with another person where one controls the other. Associated persons (referred to generally as &quot;associates&quot;) may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>two or more corporations</li>
            <li>an individual and a corporation</li>

        <p><strong>Band-empowered entity</strong> means a corporation, board, council, association, society, or other organization that is owned or controlled by a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#band">band</a>, a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#tribal">tribal council</a>, or a group of bands other than a tribal council. This policy is applicable to those band-empowered entities that are situated on a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#reserve">reserve</a>. A band-empowered entity is considered to be situated on a reserve when the entity maintains a presence on a reserve.</p>
        <p>An entity is considered to be <strong>owned</strong> by a band, a tribal council, or a group of bands other than a tribal council if <strong>either</strong> of the following conditions is met:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
            <li class="cnjnctn-col">The band, tribal council, or group of bands owns all or substantially all (90%) of the shares or holds all or substantially all of the memberships of the entity</li>
            <li class="cnjnctn-col">The band, tribal council, or group of bands holds title to the assets of the entity or controls its disposition, such that in the event of wind up or liquidation, these assets are vested in the band, tribal council or group of bands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An entity is considered to be <strong>controlled</strong> by a band, tribal council, or group of bands other than a tribal council if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
            <li class="cnjnctn-col">The band, tribal council, group of bands, or individual members of the band, tribal council, or group of bands appoint or elect a majority of the members of the governing body of the entity (for example, directors)</li>
            <li class="cnjnctn-col">The entity is required by legislation, by-laws, or an operating agreement, to submit to the band, tribal council, or group of bands, its operating budget and where applicable, its capital budget for review and approval</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Band management activities</h2>
    <div id="activities">
        <p><strong>Band management activities </strong>means activities or programs undertaken by a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#band">band</a> or <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#entity">band-empowered entity</a> that are not <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#commercial">commercial activities</a> for which they would otherwise be entitled to an <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#itc">input tax credit</a> (ITC). In determining whether the acquisition of a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#supply">supply</a> is for band management, the output of the activity or program will be the determining factor, as opposed
            to the objectives of the activity or program. For example, a band's objective of a program may be to provide employment and training to band members. To achieve this objective, the band may form a commercial enterprise which will provide on-the-job training and also create employment. Although the band's objective is to train persons, the output is a commercial activity for which there is an entitlement to ITCs. As a result, supplies acquired for use in this band program are not considered to have been acquired for use in band management activities unless the band is not required to be registered and thus not eligible to ITCs (for example, a small supplier).</p>

    <h2>Basic service</h2>
    <div id="basic">
        <p><strong>Basic service</strong> means a type of service that could be performed in a customs bonded warehouse. The service does not have to actually be performed in a customs bonded warehouse, but it should be able to be performed on the goods in their present stage of processing, and in a customs bonded warehouse. Basic services include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>disassembling or reassembling the goods if they have been assembled or disassembled for packing, handling, or transport</li>
            <li>displaying, inspecting, labelling, packing, storing, or testing the goods</li>
            <li>removing a sample of the goods for soliciting orders</li>
            <li>cleaning, diluting, normal maintenance and servicing, preserving, separating defective goods from prime quality goods, sorting or grading, trimming, filing, slitting, cutting, or complying with any applicable law of Canada or a province or territory, as long as the characteristics of the goods are not materially altered</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Basic tax content</h2>
    <div id="basic_content">
        <p><strong>Basic tax content</strong> of a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#property">property</a> generally means the amount of <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#gst">GST/HST</a> that was payable for the last acquisition of the property, and for any <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#improvement">improvements</a> made to the property since that last acquisition, less any amounts that were, or would have been, able to be recovered (for example, by rebate or remission, but not by <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#itc">input tax credits</a> (ITC)). The calculation for the basic tax content takes into account any depreciation in the value of the property since it was last acquired (for example,
            when it was purchased or when it was last deemed to have been purchased, whichever occurred more recently).</p>
        <p>Registrants may have to calculate the basic tax content of a property if they increase or decrease their use of the property in their commercial activities. Non‐registrants may have to calculate the basic tax content of real property if they file a rebate under section 257 of the Excise Tax Act.</p>
        <p>For more information on how to calculate basic tax content, see <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4022.html">Guide RC4022, General Information for GST/HST Registrants</a>.</p>

        <p>If the declaration is not made, the carrier's services are taxable at 5%, 13%, or 15% and the carrier has to collect the GST/HST on the freight transportation services provided in Canada, unless interlining applies (see <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-specific-situations/freight-carriers.html#interlining">If the freight transportation service has an interlining agreement</a>).</p>
        <p>A carrier's services are also taxable at 5%, 13%, or 15% if a shipper provides a declaration to the carrier but the goods are not exported. In this case, the carrier is not required to collect the GST/HST on its services if the carrier did not know or could not reasonably have known that the goods were being delivered to a destination in Canada. When the shipper provides a false declaration, the shipper has to account for the tax on the carrier's services.</p>
