                    <p><strong>Know your fiscal year</strong></p>
                    <p>Usually, your fiscal year for GST/HST purposes is the same as your tax year for income tax purposes. Generally, the tax year of the following persons is a calendar year:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>individuals and certain trusts</li>
                        <li>professional corporations that are members of a partnership (such as a corporation that is the professional practice of an accountant, a lawyer, or a doctor)</li>
                        <li>partnerships, where at least one member of the partnership is an individual, a professional corporation or another affected partnership</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, some persons use non-calendar tax years. If you are a person described above that uses a non-calendar tax year approved by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), you may want to use that same year as your GST/HST fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>A corporation generally uses the same fiscal year for both income tax purposes and GST/HST purposes. However, if a corporation has a non-calendar tax year for income tax purposes, it can elect to use a calendar year for its GST/HST fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>If you are a corporation that uses a non-calendar year for both income tax purposes and GST/HST purposes, and you change to another non-calendar tax year for income tax purposes, inform the CRA of the change as soon as possible and your GST/HST fiscal year will be changed to match it.
