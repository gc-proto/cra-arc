Once you have attached the file, you should ensure that your return is correct, complete and accurate. If you wish to file the information as your return, confirm that you want to file the information as your return by selecting "yes" to the declaration.</p>
    <p>We will do a preliminary check of your return. If your return meets the basic requirements, you'll receive your confirmation number. <strong>This means that your tax return has been accepted for processing.</strong> Keep this confirmation number for your records.</p>
    <p>If there are any problems with the electronic tax return you tried to send us, we'll send you an explanation of errors or corrections needed. <strong>This means your tax return was not accepted for processing</strong>. You should save, print, or make note of all messages we send. Before trying to retransmit the return, you must make the appropriate corrections within your software according to the error messages you received and re-save your file.</p>

    <h2>Is GST/HST Internet File Transfer secure?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The CRA limits access to browsers supporting Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a protocol that provides authentication, confidentially, and data integrity between communicating applications. Using the appropriate safeguards and configuration, TLS provides a method of transmitting data securely across networks. Effective implementation of TLS will assist in mitigating the most serious threats with web-based applications such as eavesdropping, data tampering, and message forgery. <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">Upgrade to TLS 1.2</a> so that your system is as secure as possible.</p>
