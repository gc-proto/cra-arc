    <p>If your accountant is authorized to file GST/HST returns on your behalf, they can use GST/HST Internet File Transfer to file your return. This method does require the use of GST/HST access code.</p>

    <p>A GST/HST access code can be created or changed over the telephone by the business owner or an authorized reprentative (with level 2 authorization or higher) while the GST/HST Access Code Online should only be used by business owners.</p>
    <p>If your accountant is not authorized to file GST/HST returns on your behalf, a more secure option is for you to sign up for <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/about-business-account.html">My Business Account</a>.
