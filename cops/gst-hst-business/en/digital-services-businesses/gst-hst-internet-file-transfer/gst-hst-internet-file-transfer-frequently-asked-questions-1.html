    <h2 id="q2">2. What are the benefits of using GST/HST Internet File Transfer?</h2>

    <h2 id="q3">3. Is GST/HST Internet File Transfer secure and confidential?</h2>
    <p>Yes. We use sophisticated encryption technology and security procedures to protect your personal information at all times. However, while we have made every possible effort to ensure the safety and integrity of transactions at our Web site, the Internet is a public network and therefore is outside our control.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q4">4. Do I need to buy software or equipment to use GST/HST Internet File Transfer?</h2>
    <p>You will need to have accounting software that supports the GST/HST Internet File Transfer. <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-internet-file-transfer/gst-hst-internet-file-transfer-software.html#crtfd">Consult our list of certified software vendors</a>. If you do not wish to use accounting software, you can still file your return electronically using <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-netfile.html">GST/HST NETFILE</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q5">5. Do I still have to send a paper return if I use GST/HST Internet File Transfer?</h2>
    <p>If you file your return using GST/HST Internet File Transfer, do not send us a paper copy of your return.</p>
    <p>However, if you are including a rebate amount on your return you must mail the corresponding rebate application form(s) to the applicable <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a> for separate processing. The tax centre should receive the form(s) on or before the due date of your return.</p>
    <p>After we have processed your return we may contact you for more information, so keep all supporting documents for <strong>six years</strong>. This applies whether you file on paper or electronically.</p>
