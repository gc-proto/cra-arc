    <h2 id="q1">1. Who is eligible to file GST/HST information electronically?</h2>
    <p>GST/HST EDI is available to GST/HST registrants across Canada, excluding those that are administered by Revenu Qu√©bec. If you are a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) that reports both the GST/HST and QST, please visit <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-which-rate/financial-institutions.html#rqfl">Determine which returns to complete and when to file</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q2">2. Can non-residents file their GST/HST returns using EDI?</h2>
    <p>Yes. However, you must complete all GST/HST amounts in Canadian dollars, and remit Canadian funds to us using a participating financial institution in Canada.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q3">3. How do I create and send an electronic GST/HST return or remittance?</h2>
    <p>Many financial institutions offer the service of creating and transmitting GST/HST returns and payment information on behalf of their clients. Once registered with one of these services, you can begin filing your returns and/or remittances electronically.</p>
    <p>You can give the necessary GST/HST return and payment information to a participating financial institution through your computer, by phone, or by any other mutually agreeable method.</p>
    <p>The financial institution will convert the information into an electronic GST/HST return and/or payment that meets our specifications, and transmit the return and/or payment to us. Some financial institutions may charge a fee for this service.</p>
