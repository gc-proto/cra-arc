<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <p>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a computer-to-computer exchange of information in a standard format. You can use EDI to file the electronic equivalent of Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>, Schedule B for the recapture of input tax credits, and Schedule C for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits.</p>
    <p>You can also pay the net tax you owe electronically through a participating Canadian financial institution.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>You will need to register with a participating financial institution. After registering, you can provide the necessary GST/HST return and payment information to them through your computer, by phone, or any other mutually agreeable method.</p>
    <p>The financial institution will convert the information into an electronic GST/HST return and/or payment that meets our specifications, and transmit the return and/or payment to us.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>The benefits of using EDI</h2>
    <p>There are advantages to filing your return using EDI whether you are receiving a refund or making a payment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>accuracy&nbsp;</strong>- you key in the information, eliminating transcription errors from further handling</li>
        <li><strong>cash flow control&nbsp;</strong>- transfer of funds is guaranteed on the value date you establish with your financial institution</li>
        <li><strong>quicker refund payments&nbsp;</strong>- your GST/HST refund can be <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">deposited directly</a> into your account within 10-15 calendar days</li>
        <li><strong>convenience&nbsp;</strong>- EDI ends the need to mail a return</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h2>Books and records</h2>
    <p>You do not have to send any receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically, and no signature is required. However, you have to <strong>keep your records for six years</strong> after the end of the year to which they apply and provide them to us upon request.</p>
