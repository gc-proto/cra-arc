    <h2 id="q1">1. Who can use GST/HST TELEFILE?</h2>
    <p>GST/HST TELEFILE is available to GST/HST registrants across Canada and the United States, excluding those with accounts that are administered by Revenu Qu√©bec. For more information on whether you are eligible to use this service, go to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-telefile/gst-hst-telefile-eligibility.html">Eligibility</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q2">2. Can I file a return with an amount owing?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Go to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments-cra.html">Make a payment to the Canada Revenue Agency</a> to find out your payment options.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q3">3. Can First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts use the service?</h2>
    <p>Yes. However, after filing your return, you still have to mail Form GST 499-1 (the corresponding FNT schedule) to the <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-centres.html#summ">Atlantic Tax Centre</a>.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q4">4. Can my accountant use GST/HST TELEFILE to file my return?</h2>
    <p>If your accountant is legally authorized to sign the paper copy of your GST/HST return on your behalf, he or she may use GST/HST TELEFILE to file your return. This method does require the use of a GST/HST access code.</p>
    <p>Note that your GST/HST access code is your personal security key to filing your return using GST/HST TELEFILE. Please do not give your access code to anyone not authorized to act on your behalf.</p>
    <p>A GST/HST access code can be created or changed over the telephone by the business owner or an authorized representative (with level 2 authorization or higher) while the GST/HST Access Code Online should only be used by business owners.</p>
    <p>If your accountant is not authorized to file GST/HST returns on your behalf, a more secure option is for you to sign up for <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/about-business-account.html">My business Account</a>. This secure online portal provides additional services, and you can add accountant as your authorized representative.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q5">5. Is GST/HST TELEFILE the only electronic filing service available for GST/HST returns?</h2>
    <p>No. If you are eligible to file using GST/HST TELEFILE, you can also use <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-netfile.html">GST/HST NETFILE</a> or <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-internet-file-transfer.html">GST/HST Internet File Transfer</a> to file your return via the Internet.</p>
    <p>In addition, the <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-filing-remitting.html">GST/HST EDI Filing and Remitting</a> program allows you to file your returns and send your payments using electronic data interchange (EDI) technology.</p>
