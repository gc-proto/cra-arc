    <h2 id="q5">5. Are there any helpful hints on how to use the service?</h2>
    <p>The GST/HST TELEFILE service will guide you through the process step by step. Here are some things to know before you call to file your return:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter all the digits of your Business Number, but <strong>do not</strong> enter the letters &quot;RT&quot;.</li>
        <li>Press &quot;*&quot; to have a message repeated.</li>
        <li>Press &quot;1&quot; to answer <em>yes</em> or &quot;0&quot; to answer <em>no</em>.</li>
        <li>Press &quot;#&quot; when you have finished entering an amount.</li>
        <li>GST/HST TELEFILE repeats each entry. To help you file an accurate return, you have to confirm each entry. Make any necessary corrections before you confirm your amounts.</li>
        <li>If you hang up at any time before confirming that you want to file your return, the information you entered will not be saved. You can hang up and call again up to a maximum of six times.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q6">6. What happens to my return after I have filed it using GST/HST TELEFILE?</h2>
    <p>At the end of the call, you will immediately receive a six-digit confirmation number and we will start to process your return. Write down your confirmation number, and keep it with your records.</p>
    <p>Returns that are filed using GST/HST TELEFILE are reviewed like all other returns. You should keep your working copy for your records. It and any other information you use to prepare your return are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q7">7. Can I use GST/HST TELEFILE to change a return that I've already filed?</h2>
    <p>Returns can only be adjusted electronically using the <em>My Business Account</em> (MyBA) portal. If you do not already have a MyBA user ID and password, you can request one at <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are not registered with MyBA, send your adjustment request, in writing, to your tax centre. </p>
