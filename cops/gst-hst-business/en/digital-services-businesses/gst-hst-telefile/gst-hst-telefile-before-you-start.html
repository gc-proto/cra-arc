<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <p>Before you start, we recommend that you complete the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>verify that you are <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-telefile/gst-hst-telefile-eligibility.html">eligible</a> to use GST/HST TELEFILE;</li>
        <li>prepare your return information in Canadian funds; and,</li>
        <li>if you have an amount owing, find out how to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments-cra.html">make a payment to the Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>How do you file your return?</h2>
    <p>Once you have completed these steps, call the toll-free telephone number using a touch-tone phone, and enter your return information when prompted by the automated messages. When you successfully file your return, you will be given a six-digit confirmation number for your records.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>Access code</h2>
    <p>To use GST/HST TELEFILE, you will need the four-digit access code. Your access code will be the same for all future returns. You can change your access code to a number of your choice by using <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-netfile/need-access-code.html">GST/HST Access Code Online</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have never received an access code, call us at 1-800-959-5525 and we will give you one. If you are calling from outside Canada and the United States, call us collect at 613-940-8497.</p>

    <h2>Joint filers</h2>
    <p>If you are the coordinator of a closely related group of corporations (i.e. you have filed election GST303) and you file returns electronically, you must still send your letter of direction to your <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-centres.html">tax centre</a>.</p>
