    <h2 id="q1">1. How do I use GST/HST TELEFILE?</h2>
    <p>If you are eligible to use GST/HST TELEFILE, call the toll-free telephone number using a touch-tone telephone and enter your return information when prompted by the automated voice message system.</p>
    <p>Once you have confirmed all of the information, we will immediately issue you a confirmation number.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q2">2. What are the benefits of using GST/HST TELEFILE?</h2>
    <p>GST/HST TELEFILE is fast, easy to use, and available seven days a week. The service reduces processing time and ends the need to mail a paper return. This results in faster refunds.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q3">3. Is GST/HST TELEFILE secure and confidential?</h2>
    <p>Yes. However, to ensure privacy while using GST/HST TELEFILE, you should not use a cordless or cellular telephone. Wireless technology can easily be intercepted or picked up by various electronic devices.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q4">4. Do I still have to send a paper return if I use GST/HST TELEFILE?</h2>
    <p>If you file your return using GST/HST TELEFILE, do not send us a paper copy of your return. </p>
    <p>However, if you are including a rebate amount on your return, you must mail the corresponding rebate application form(s) to the applicable tax centre for separate processing. The tax centre should receive the form(s) on or before the due date of your return.</p>
    <p>After we have processed your return we may contact you for more information, so keep all supporting documents for <strong>six years</strong>. This applies whether you file on paper or electronically.</p>
</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="q5">5. If I file a return using GST/HST TELEFILE, when does the CRA consider it to be received?</h2>
    <p>We consider a return that you filed using GST/HST TELEFILE to be received when we issue a confirmation number. This happens when you answer yes to the question that asks you to confirm that the information that you gave should be filed as your GST/HST return.</p>
