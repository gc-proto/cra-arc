    <h2>Is GST/HST NETFILE secure?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The CRA limits access to browsers supporting Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a protocol that provides authentication, confidentially, and data integrity between communicating applications. Using the appropriate safeguards and configuration, TLS provides a method of transmitting data securely across networks. Effective implementation of TLS will assist in mitigating the most serious threats with web-based applications such as eavesdropping, data tampering, and message forgery. <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">Upgrade to TLS 1.2</a> so that your system is as secure as possible.</p>
