        <li>review the checklist of items on the <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-netfile/gst-hst-netfile-ready-file-online-check-list.html">Ready to file</a> page before you begin;</li>
