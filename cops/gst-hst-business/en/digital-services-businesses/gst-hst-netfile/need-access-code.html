    <p>Did you know that you may not need to have a GST/HST access code?</p>
    <p>You can file your GST/HST returns through the CRA's <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> which is more secure option and provides additional services. This method does not require the use of a GST/HST access code.</p>
    <p>To get access to My Business Account, you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your CRA user ID and password, or a Sign-In Partner; and</li>
        <li>a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cops/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/business-number.html">Business Number</a> (BN) to which you currently have associated your Social Insurance Number (SIN) or Individual Tax Number (ITN).</li>

    <p>Should you still need a GST/HST access code, here is what you need to do as a business owner.</p>
    <p>As a business owner, you can change your GST/HST access code to a number of your choice by using GST/HST Access Code Online.</p>
    <p>A GST/HST access code can also be created over the telephone by the business owner or an authorized representative (with level 2 authorization or higher).</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>GST/HST Access Code Online</h2>
    <p>GST/HST Access Code Online lets you change your current access code to a number of your choice. Your new access code can be used to file all future returns. Your original access code will no longer be valid.</p>
    <p>To change your GST/HST access code, you will need to enter your business number and your choice of the following information from a previously filed return:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the reporting period and line 109 (net tax) where the amount on line 109 is not $0.00; <strong>or</strong>,</li>
        <li>the reporting period and confirmation number from a return filed using GST/HST NETFILE, TELEFILE, or Internet File Transfer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have never received an access code, call us at <span class="nowrap">1-800-959-5525</span> and we will give you one. If you are calling from outside Canada and the United States, call us collect at <span class="nowrap">613-940-8497</span>.</p>
