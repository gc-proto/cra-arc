<details>
        <summary>What ‘paid for in full’ means for partial payments</summary>
        <p><strong>Partial payments</strong> for a qualifying item must <strong>each be made</strong> between December 14, 2024, and February 15, 2025. However, there is an exception for deposits.</p>
            <p>If a <strong>deposit</strong> was paid on a qualifying item before December 14, 2024, the item would still qualify as long as:
<ul>
<li>The entire remaining amount is paid between December 14, 2024, and February 15, 2025 </li>
    <li>The item is delivered (or made available) by February 15, 2025</li>

                <details>
        <summary>What ‘delivered’ means for shipped items</summary>
        <p>Generally, deliveries to consumers (such as most online shopping) are shipped <strong>on behalf of the seller</strong>. This means we consider those items <strong>delivered when the item arrives at the destination address</strong>.</p>
            <p>However, if a supplier uses a shipping service (common carrier or consignee) for delivery <strong>on behalf of the recipient</strong>, we consider the buyer to have been delivered to the buyer <strong>at the time the supplier transfers the item to the shipping service</strong>.
        </p></details></li>

    <p>The items that qualify for GST/HST relief during this period qualify whether they are being purchased <strong>retail or wholesale</strong>.</p>


    <h3>Items purchased from other countries</h3>
    <p>Imported goods qualify for the temporary GST/HST relief as long as they meet the other qualifying conditions.</p>

    <h2 id="toc1">How to get this tax break as a shopper</h2>
    <p>As a shopper, <strong>you will automatically receive this tax break</strong> on the qualifying things you buy. There will be no GST/HST charged on the item when you make your purchase.</p>


    <h2 id="toc2">What to do as a business that charges the GST/HST</h2>

    <p>From December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025, <strong> do not charge the GST/HST</strong> on the qualifying goods and services listed above.</p>
    <p>Keep your records and remit and report your regular GST/HST as usual.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>In detail: zero-rating supplies of the qualifying goods and services</summary>
        <p>The proposed measure would make an adjustment to the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> to temporarily zero-rate supplies of the qualifying goods and services. Zero-rated means that no GST/HST is charged when the supply is made because the tax rate is 0%. </p>
        <p>GST/HST registrants can claim an <strong>input tax credit</strong> for the GST/HST paid or payable on expenses made to provide zero-rated supplies. </p>
