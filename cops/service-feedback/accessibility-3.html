<h2 id="toc0">What is accessibility feedback</h2>
<p>Accessibility feedback may be a complaint, suggestion or compliment about the accessibility of CRA programs and services. </p>
<p>The CRA is committed to removing or addressing physical, architectural, technological or attitudinal barriers that hinder the full and equal participation in society of persons with an impairment. Impairments include physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairments or functional limitations.</p>
<p>Your feedback can help us make our programs and services more accessible. We welcome:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Feedback on barriers that you experience when dealing with the CRA</li>
		<li>Feedback that will help inform our accessibility plan</li></ul>
<p>If your feedback is about a particular issue you have experienced, make sure to be descriptive and include details such as the date, the platform, and the name of the webpage, application or service involved.</p>

	<p>For more information on accessibility at the CRA, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/accessibility-plan.html#h_2">CRA Accessibility Plan</a></p>
