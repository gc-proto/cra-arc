<h2 id="h1">What are scams</h2>
<!--<p>Scams are when a person contacts you, impersonating the government or a business. They might say they are from the CRA, but they aren't.  They  really just want to trick you and take your money. There are many types of scams, and new ones are invented daily.</p>-->
<p>As a taxpayer, you should be cautious if you receive any communication that claims to be from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and requests personal information such as a social insurance number (SIN), credit card number, bank account number, or passport number.</p>
<p>Scams may insist that personal information is needed so that you can receive a refund or a benefit payment. Cases of fraudulent communication could also involve threatening or coercive language to scare you into paying a false debt to the CRA. Other communications could direct you to visit a fake CRA website where you are asked to verify your identity by entering personal information.</p>
<p><strong>If you are unsure and want to confirm if the CRA contacted you, call:</strong></p>

  </summary>
  <p>The CRA has introduced <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/multi-factor-authentication-access-cra-login-services.html#toc5">multi-factor authentication</a> for all of its sign-in services. If you enrolled with the telephone option, you will receive a text message with a one-time passcode each time you sign in to your CRA account.</p>
  <p>The CRA will not use text messages or instant messaging such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp to start a conversation with you about your taxes, benefits, or My Account under any circumstance.</p>
  <h4>When in doubt, ask yourself</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the CRA have my most recent contact information, such as my email and address?</li>
    <li>Do I have an instalment payment due soon?</li>
  </ul>

    <summary>Text or instant message offering a refund</summary>
    <p><strong>What is it: </strong>A text message scam impersonating the CRA to offer fake refunds to Canadians. This is known as phishing.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it: </strong>Scammers will send a message from a fake number to your phone or tablet. They will claim to be the CRA and offer a refund, encouraging you to click on a link provided in their message.</p>
    <p>They may asked you to provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>personal information such as your SIN, date of birth or your name </li>
      <li>online banking information to accept the refund by e-transfer </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What to do: </strong>Do not reply to the text message or send them any personal information. </p>
    <p>The CRA will not use text messages or instant messages to start a conversation with you about your refund. </p>
