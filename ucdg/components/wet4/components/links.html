         <ul>
            <li>include links that directly support the topic or task on the current page</li>
            <li>link to the original information posted by the authoritative source </li>
            <li>don't include links to intranet sites unless the content targets government employees, in which case you should add "(accessible only on the Government of Canada network)"</li>
            <li>don't bury links that are crucial to completing a task in the middle of a paragraph or at the bottom of the page</li>

            <h3 id="h-1-9">Link to content correctly</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks  guide users to the information they are looking for. Use hyperlinks to avoid  repeating information that is already clearly expressed on another web page or  to reference related information, such as definitions, supporting information,  and background information.</p>
<p><strong>Use the title of the  target page as the text in the hyperlink</strong>. It is very confusing to  users if the link text and page name don't match. In  situations when you need to modify the link text, try to <strong>match the text as closely as possible</strong> to the page name.</p>
<p>To meet accessibility requirements,make the <strong>target  of each link clear, and without any additional context beyond the link text</strong>.&nbsp; Screen reader users can read pages by  generating a list of all the links on the page, and tab from link to link  without any surrounding context. If the wording of the link does not clearly  summarize the content of the target, it can confuse screen reader users. Refer to <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/writing/strctr-en.html#heading">Optimize headings and menu labels</a>. </p>
<p>If  you refer to another web page more than once, <strong>add a hyperlink only to the first reference</strong>. Avoid putting  too many hyperlinks in a single paragraph. It can be confusing if they  are too close together. Users are not always able to tell where one hyperlink  ends and the next one begins.</p>
<p>Users  are attracted to hyperlinks and follow them if they see them. Since you don’t  want users to ignore the content of the page they are on<strong>, only add a hyperlink to references that can help users complete their  task or that provide valuable information about the task.</strong> Do not add a  hyperlink to unnecessary or unrelated information. Too many hyperlinks are  distracting and it becomes difficult for users to distinguish between important  and unimportant information. Ensure that the hyperlinks direct users to the  right page. Refer to <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/writing/stl-en.html#scent">Create clear paths to  information</a> for more on hyperlinks.</p>

            <h3 id="h-1-2">Carefully select related content</h3>
            <p>Providing links to other relevant web pages can help people find related information quickly. Links to your pages from other pages may also help improve where your page ranks in search results. </p>
            <p>Be sure to select related links carefully. Too many links on a page can cause people to leave the page without reading important information or can discourage them from completing a task. </p>

         <section>
            <h3 id="h-1-3">Write descriptive links</h3>
            <p>A link must describe the content a person will find once they click on it. It's easier to complete a task when a link's destination matches a person's expectations. Make sure links are descriptive so that person will understand what they'll get when they click on them.</p>
            <p>The text you hyperlink doesn't have to match the title of the destination page to be compliant with <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</cite>. Text in a link gets some context from the web page's content. Make sure the main keywords of the link text correspond to the page title so that people know they're in the right place. </p>
