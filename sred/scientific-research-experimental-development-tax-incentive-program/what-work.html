</ul>
<h2 id="h1">Fundamental requirements of SR&amp;ED work</h2>
<p>Eligible work must meet certain fundamental requirements to be considered scientific research and experimental development.</p>
		 <p>Your reason for doing the work (<strong>why</strong> you started it) and the way in which you approach the work (<strong>how</strong> you carry it out) will help determine if the work is in fact SR&amp;ED. </p>
<p> Eligible SR&amp;ED work must include the 3 following items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A scientific or technological <strong>uncertainty</strong> that you tried to overcome</li>
	<li>A systematic <strong>investigation or search</strong> that you carried out to overcome the uncertainty</li>
	<li>An <strong>advancement</strong> that you achieved or tried to achieve</li>
</ul>
		 <p>Review the legal definition of SR&amp;ED: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines-eligibility-work-sred-tax-incentives.html#id_1">SR&amp;ED is defined in the Income Tax Act</a></p>
		 
<h3>The uncertainty </h3>
<p>SR&amp;ED work must be based on a  scientific or technological uncertainty that you are trying to overcome. </p>
<p>The uncertainty may exist because of a current gap or limitation in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scntfctchnlgclknwldg">scientific or technological knowledge</a>   available at the time. It is the reason for starting the SR&amp;ED work.</p>
<p> You must be able to explain  the gap in the existing knowledge when you started the work, the uncertainty, and your attempt to resolve the uncertainty.  </p>
<h3><a>The investigation or [re]search</a></h3>
<p>The work to overcome the uncertainty must be carried out through experiment and analysis. It is not sufficient to simply use known design methods or established techniques.</p>
<p>The work must be a systematic investigation or search.</p>
<p>You must be able to explain the work that was done and describe how you gained the knowledge you needed to overcome the uncertainty.</p>
             
<details>             
<summary>What a systematic investigation includes</summary>
	<p>The systematic investigation or search required by the SR&ED tax incentive program is more than simply having a systematic approach to your work. It must include all the following:</p>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0">
  <dt>A hypothesis</dt>
  <dd>The idea that triggers your investigation to overcome the uncertainty (it may be a possible solution to a problem, a proposed method, or an approach)</dd>
  <dt>An experiment</dt>
  <dd>The experiment or analysis conducted to test your hypothesis, which may change or evolve as a result of the testing</dd>
  <dt>Results obtained</dt>
  <dd>The results or findings of the experiment</dd>
	<dt>Conclusions</dt>
  <dd>The logical conclusions that are based on the results obtained</dd>
</dl>
	<!--<ol>
  <li>The hypothesis:
    <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
      <li>The idea that triggered your  investigation to overcome the uncertainty </li>
      <li>You may express this as a  possible solution to a problem, a proposed method, or an approach.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The experiment: 
    <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
      <li>The experiment and/or analysis conducted to test your hypothesis. This may change or evolve as a result  of the testing</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The results obtained: </li>
      <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>The results or findings of the  experiment or analysis</li>
      </ol>      
    <li>The conclusions:
            <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
              <li>The logical conclusions that are based on  the results obtained</li>
            </ol>    
      </li>
</ol>-->
</details>
    
<h3>The advancement</h3>
<p>The advancement is the increase in knowledge that  your SR&amp;ED work achieved. It&rsquo;s how the work improved the scientific or  technological knowledge base that existed when you started the work. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s the advancement in the  underlying science or technology that is important, not how the work advanced  your business or business practices.</p>
<p> You <strong>do not have to achieve your objective</strong> to gain new knowledge. </p>
<p> For example, if your work allowed you to  understand that the idea you tested is not a solution for your situation, this  can be considered new knowledge. </p>
		 
<h2 id="h2">Eligible research and development work</h2>
<p>Work that is  eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives must be in the fields of science or  technology and must be carried out in Canada. Eligible types of research and development work include the following:</p>
<h3>Basic  research<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Basic research is work that aims to increase the scientific or technological knowledge base. It often takes place in laboratories and may be published in scientific journals. </p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of basic research</summary>
  <p>An example of basic research is the study of a newly discovered virus to better understand its  characteristics.</p>
</details>

<h3>Applied research</h3>
<p>Applied research is also work that aims to increase scientific or technological knowledge, but it has a specific practical application in view. Like basic research, the work often takes place in laboratories and may be published in scientific journals.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of applied research</summary>
  <p>An example of applied research would be efforts to  develop a vaccine against a new virus by exploiting some identified characteristics of that newly discovered virus.</p>
</details>
		 
<h3>Experimental  development<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Experimental development is work that aims to increase scientific or technological knowledge from research and more practical experience. The work attempts to develop new or improved materials, devices, products, or processes.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of experimental development</summary>
  <p>An example of when experimental development could occur might be during the scale up and optimization of processes to enable large scale and rapid production of a vaccine.</p>
</details>
		 
<h3>Eligible support work </h3>
<p><a>Support work is not SR&amp;ED, but  it may be eligible if it <strong>corresponds and directly supports the SR&amp;ED work</strong> you&rsquo;re doing. </a></p>
<p> Types  of eligible support work: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a>engineering</a></li>
  <li>design</li>
  <li>operations research</li>
  <li>mathematical analysis</li>
  <li>computer programming</li>
  <li>data collection</li>
  <li>testing</li>
  <li>psychological research<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>Example of support work</summary>
  <p>For example, if you are developing a vaccine, you may perform tests on the virus to observe its  characteristics. This testing would be considered support work of your basic research.</p>
</details>
