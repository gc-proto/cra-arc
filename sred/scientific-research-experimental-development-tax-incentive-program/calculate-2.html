</ul>
<h2 id="h1">Deduct some or all of your expenditures</h2>
<p>Once you have calculated your  allowable SR&amp;ED expenditures, you will need to deduct  them against business income that you earned. The  result will be your pool of  deductible expenditures.</p>
<p> You have the option to deduct some or all of the allowable expenditures that are available for the tax year. Any balance you don&rsquo;t claim can be  carried forward to future years. </p>
<p> Your pool of deductible expenditures accumulates over time and can be  adjusted depending on your business needs.</p>
<p> If you used the proxy method  to calculate your allowable expenditures, the prescribed proxy amount (PPA) is not  included in the pool of deductible expenditures. </p>

<h3>If you&rsquo;re a member of a partnership</h3>
<p>In a partnership, the  pool of deductible expenditures is deducted at the partnership level.  Individual members cannot make separate deductions.</p>
<p> Partnerships must  claim all of the available pool of deductible expenditures in the year. It will not have a pool of expenditures to carry  forward to future tax years.</p>
<p> Review the guide for  more information on how partnerships calculate their pool of deductibles:<br>
  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4088/guide-form-t661-scientific-research-experimental-development-expenditures-claim-guide-form-t661.html#toc28">T4088  - Guide to T661, Partnerships</a></p>
<h2 id="h2">Adjusting your pool of deductible expenditures          </h2>

<h3>Deduct amounts you  receive</h3>
<p>You will need to deduct any government and non-government assistance you received,  expect to receive or are entitled to receive in the tax year from your total allowable SR&amp;ED  expenditures.</p>
<p> This may include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Provincial  &amp; territorial assistance (if not <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4088/guide-form-t661-scientific-research-experimental-development-expenditures-claim-guide-form-t661.html#ln429">renounced</a>) </li>
  <li>Other  government or non-government assistance</li>
  <li>Any SR&amp;ED  ITC claimed the previous year (refunds, applied or carried back)</li>
  <li>Any  sale of SR&amp;ED capital assets and other deductions <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Add repayments and other amounts</h3>
<p>You will need to add any repayments you made in the tax year for government  or non-government assistance that reduced your pool. </p>
<p> You may also add the previous year&rsquo;s pool balance of deductible  expenditures that you are carrying forward and any SR&amp;ED expenditure  transfers or recaptures, if applicable.</p>
<details>             
<summary>If you  have a negative pool balance</summary>
<p> The pool of deductible SR&amp;ED expenditures at the beginning of a tax  year cannot be a negative amount. If there is a negative balance in the pool at  the end of a tax year, you must bring it into that tax year&rsquo;s net income. </p>
<p> This amount is also technically added to the pool to remove the negative  amount and results in an opening balance of nil (zero).</p>
</details>    
<p>Review the policy: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/pool-deductible-expenditures-policy.html">Pool  of Deductible SR&amp;ED Expenditures Policy</a></p>
<h2 id="h3">Get support with deductible expenditures</h2>
<h3>Request a pre-claim consultation (PCC)</h3>
<p>Request a  pre-claim consultation (PCC) to get support before you submit you claim. A PCC  can help you understand if a specific project is eligible as SR&amp;ED work or  what types of expenditures should be reported/are allowable.</p>
