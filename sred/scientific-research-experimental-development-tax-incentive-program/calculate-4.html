<h2 id="h1">Use your ITC to reduce income</h2>
<p>You may earn an  investment tax credit (ITC) on your qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures for the  year. This may reduce your income tax payable for the year. If you have excess  ITCs in the year, you may also get a refund.</p>
<h3>Who can earn an ITC</h3>
<p> The following entities may earn a ITC on their qualified SR&amp;ED  expenditures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Corporations</li>
  <li>Individuals</li>
  <li>Beneficiary  of a trust</li>
  <li>Member  of a partnership </li>
</ul>
             
<details>             
<summary>Partnerships  cannot earn an ITC</summary>
<p> Since a partnership is not a taxpayer, it cannot earn an  ITC. In general, the ITC is calculated at the partnership level and then  allocated to eligible members of the partnership (individuals, corporations or  trusts). </p>
<p>If you are submitting a partnership claim for SR&amp;ED, refer  to: <br>
  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/claims-partnerships-policy.html">SR&amp;ED Claims for Partnerships Policy</a></p>
</details>
             
<h3>Complete the ITC form to calculate your amount</h3>
<h3>To calculate your ITC amount, you  must complete the investment tax credit forms for either corporations or individuals.</h3>

<h4>For corporations</h4>
<p>To calculate a SR&amp;ED ITC  for corporations, use:<br>
  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Form T2SCH31, Investment Tax Credit - Corporations</a></p>
<p>If you are an  associated corporation, you will also need to complete:<br>
  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch49.html">Schedule&nbsp;49, Agreement Among Associated CCPCs to  Allocate the Expenditure Limit</a>.</p>
<h4>For individuals</h4>
<p>To calculate a  SR&amp;ED ITC for individuals and beneficiaries of trusts, use:<br>
  <a href="file:///\\Omega.dce-eir.net\natdfs\CRA\HQ\PAB\PAB_H34\UV\zzq861\HOMEDIR\My%20Documents\Local_SR&ED\Local%20SRED%20DRAFTS\T2038-IND%20Investment%20Tax%20Credit%20(Individuals)">Form  T2038-IND, Investment Tax Credit (Individuals)</a></p>

<h2 id="h2">Understand ITC rates</h2>
<h3>Basic rate</h3>
<p>The basic ITC  rate is <strong>15% on qualified SR&amp;ED  expenditures</strong> for individuals, beneficiaries of trusts, members of a  partnership, or corporations that are not Canadian controlled private corporations (CCPCs). </p>
<h3>Enhanced rate</h3>
<p>Most Canadian  controlled private corporations (CCPCs) may earn an ITC on qualified SR&amp;ED  expenditures at the enhanced <strong>rate of 35%,  up to a maximum threshold of $3 million</strong>. This is called the expenditure limit.</p>
<p>Any qualified  expenditures <strong>beyond the expenditure limit  earn an ITC at the basic rate of 15%</strong>. </p>
<p>If a CCPC is a  qualifying corporation, 40% of the ITC earned at 15% can be refunded.</p>
<details>             
<summary>What qualifying corporation means</summary>
<p> A qualifying  corporation is a Canadian controlled private corporation (CCPC) whose 
  taxable income  (or total taxable income if associated with another corporation) in the  previous year was not more than their qualifying income limit for the current  year.</p>
<p> For more  information, review policy: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s4_2">SR&amp;ED  ITC Policy, Qualifying corporation</a></p>
</details>    
<h2 id="h3">Determine expenditure limit</h2>
<p>Some CCPCs may  have a reduced expenditure limit that  is lower than $3 million. </p>
<p>The limit starts  to decrease when the CCPC&rsquo;s taxable capital employed  in Canada for the previous tax year reaches $10 million. The limit becomes zero  starting at $50 million.</p>
<p>Other factors can also reduce the ITC expenditure  limit for CCPCs, including short tax years and having multiple tax years within  one calendar year.</p>
<p>For more information on the expenditure limits,  review the policy: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s3_1">SR&amp;ED  ITC Policy, Determining the expenditure limit</a></p>

<h3>Expenditure limit for associated  corporations</h3>
<p>If your corporation is associated with one or more&nbsp;CCPCs, you must allocate the expenditure limit  among the associated&nbsp;CCPCs.</p>
<p>All the associated corporations  in the group must file the T2 Schedule 49 that allocates the expenditure limit  among them or the expenditure limit is zero.</p>
<details>
<summary>What an  associated corporation means</summary>
<p>The CRA considers 2 or more  corporations to be associated for SR&amp;ED if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>they are  associated with the same third corporation </li>
  <li>the main reason  for the separate existence is to reduce income tax payable or increase the  amount of refundable ITCs  </li>
</ul>
<p>For SR&amp;ED, the CRA does not consider a corporation associated if the  only reason they are associated is because 2 or more investors have shares in each  corporation, provided that: (as long as)</p>
<ul>
  <li>The corporations  aren&rsquo;t associated for any other reason</li>
  <li>There is at least  one shareholder of one corporation who is not a shareholder of the other  corporation -- and it&rsquo;s not for the purpose of satisfying these provisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s3_2">SR&amp;ED  ITC Policy, Associated corporations</a></p>
</details>    
<p>Some associated CCPCs may also have a reduced expenditure  limit. </p>
<p>The limit starts to decrease  when the taxable capital employed in Canada of the CCPC and its associated  corporations for their last tax years ending in the preceding calendar year reaches  $10 million. It becomes zero starting at $50 million.</p>
<p>The allocated ITC for  associated corporations can be earned at the enhanced rate of 35%. </p>
<p>If there is anything left above  that, it may be allocated to an associated corporation. However, the amount must  not exceed the expenditure limit of the associated group for the applicable tax  year.</p>

<h2 id="h4">Carry back or carry forward an ITC</h2>
<p>If you have an unused  ITC beyond the amount needed to reduce your income tax payable to zero, you may carry it back 3 years or  carry it forward 20 years. This lets you use the credit to reduce your tax  payable for other years.</p>
<p>A refunded ITC  will reduce the credit available for carry back or forward.</p>
<p>Review the policy: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s3_3_2">SR&amp;ED  ITC Policy, Carrying back ITCs</a></p>

<h2 id="h5">Refundable ITC</h2>
<p>Claimants may be able to have some or all of their  SR&amp;ED ITC refunded. If the ITC isn&rsquo;t applied in the year to reduce income  tax payable and is not carried back, it may be refundable.</p>
<p>Most CCPCs can earn a refundable ITC at the  enhanced rate of 35% on qualified expenditures up to their expenditure limit  for the tax year. Individuals may earn a refundable ITC at 15%. Generally an  ITC can only be refunded in the year that the qualified expenditure occurred.</p>
<p>The refund rate varies depending on if the  claimant is a corporation, an individual, a beneficiary of a trust, or a member  of a partnership.</p>
