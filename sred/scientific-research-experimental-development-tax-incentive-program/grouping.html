</ul>
<h2 id="h1">What is a SR&amp;ED  project </h2>
<p>Only SR&amp;ED work can be eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives, but not all the work your business does will be  SR&amp;ED. To claim SR&amp;ED tax incentives, you need to identify your eligible work and then group it into one or more SR&amp;ED projects. </p>
<p> A SR&amp;ED project is a set of connected activities that together achieves the scientific or technological advancement you seek. </p>
<details>             
<summary> Example of a SR&amp;ED  project</summary>
<p>Let's say your business is developing a vaccine for a new virus. Some parts of that development work are directly related to resolving an uncertainty, such as not knowing how the virus reacts. </p>
<p>But other parts of the work do not directly relate to resolving the uncertainty, such as procuring a culture.</p>
<p>Only the activities directly related to resolving the uncertainty, that is, discovering how the virus reacts, would be considered part of the SR&amp;ED project.</p>
</details>
<h3>Lifecycle of a SR&amp;ED project</h3>		 
<p>A SRED project starts when you identify the scientific or technological uncertainty. If you find that you have several uncertainties, you may actually have several SR&amp;ED projects.</p>
<p>A SR&amp;ED project ends when new scientific or technological knowledge is gained, whether you were  successful in resolving the uncertainty or not. A SR&amp;ED project may still be eligible even if the results you sought were not achieved.</p>
<p>After you have grouped your work into SR&amp;ED projects, you can then determine the related expenditures that you may claim for the year.</p>
<p>While some SR&amp;ED projects can last several years, you may only claim the expenditures incurred during the tax year for which you are claiming. </p>
<h2 id="h2">How to group your work into SR&amp;ED  projects </h2>
<h3>Different ways to group work</h3>
<p>The first step in grouping SR&amp;ED work into a SR&amp;ED project is to separate work that is done to achieve the scientific or technological  advancement from other work you may have done that is not SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p>Depending on how your business projects are organized, there  are different ways you can group your SR&amp;ED work. </p>
 
<details>             
<summary>What business project means</summary>
<p>The purpose of a business project is to achieve commercial success. The lifecycle of a business project may include many activities, often grouped into different projects, phases, and milestones. </p>
<p>The purpose of a SR&amp;ED project is to advance scientific knowledge  or to achieve a technological advancement.</p>
</details>    
<h3>SR&amp;ED  project scenarios</h3>

<img src="test.png" class="img-responsive mrgn-tp-lg mrgn-bttm-lg">             
             
<p> <strong>SR&amp;ED project scenario 1: all activities in your  business project are eligible </strong></p>
<p>  Your entire business project may working toward achieving an  advancement in scientific knowledge or technological uncertainty or for the  purpose of achieving technological advancement. This means all the activities  taking place would form an SR&amp;ED project.</p>
<p> <strong>SR&amp;ED project  scenario 2: some of the activities within a business project are eligible</strong></p>
<p>  Your business project may have a mix of eligible and ineligible work.</p>
<p> <strong>SR&amp;ED project  scenario 3: some of the activities over several business projects are eligible</strong></p>
<p>  Your business may have several projects where eligible work is happening. You  can group these activities across your business projects into SR&amp;ED  projects. </p>
<h3>Basic steps to grouping you work into a project</h3>
<ol class="lst-stps">
    <li>
	    <p><strong>Identify the activities</strong></p>
	    <p>Identify all the tasks you carried out that were directly related to overcoming the uncertainty.</p>

    </li>
    <li>    
      <p><strong>Include SR&amp;ED support work</strong>  </p>
      <p> You may include all support work that corresponds and directly supports your eligible SR&amp;ED work.</p>

        <details>
        <summary>Types of support work to include</summary>
        <p>Eligible support work may include the following activities:</p>

<h3>Assess the eligibility of your work</h3>
<p>Use the  Self-assessment and learning tool (SALT) to better understand which parts of  your work may qualify as SR&amp;ED work.</p>

<h3>Request a pre-claim consultation (PCC)</h3>
<p><a>Request a pre-claim consultation (PCC) to get support before you submit  your claim. A PCC can help you understand if a specific project is eligible for  SR&amp;ED tax incentives.</a></p>
