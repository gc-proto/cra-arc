<h2>December 2025 update</h2>
<p>Updated Github json: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/sred/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/doaction-dates-en.json">https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/sred/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/doaction-dates-en.json</a></p>

<h3>Edits made to Get Ready page:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Changed the min and max dates in the input fields (2 spots)</p>
<code>
&lt;input class=&quot;form-control&quot; type=&quot;date&quot; id=&quot;enddate2&quot; name=&quot;enddate2&quot; min=&quot;2024-01-01&quot; max=&quot;2026-12-31&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</code>
</li>

<li><p>Changed the regex on the json manager part (2 spots). (I feel like this could be altered to capture all years in the first part but I didn't want to mess with it.)</p>
<code>
&quot;match&quot;: &quot;^202[4,5,6]-[1,0][0-9]-[0,1,2,3][0-9]$&quot;,
</code>
</li>

<li><p>Changed the /corp to /corporations in the json manager part since that's how the AI outputed the json (1 spot corp section)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Edits made to json file:</h3>

<p>Generated with ChatGPT with a bunch of prompts... I asked it to give me a proper prompt for next time and this is what it spit out:</p>

<code>
<pre>	
I have a JSON file with two top-level sections: "trusts" and "corporations".
Each section contains many date keys in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

For each date, the value must be one line only, formatted exactly like this:

"2024-01-02" : ["2024-04-01","2025-04-01"]

No multi-line arrays.

The first row in each section must ALWAYS be:

"bad-date" : ["Date not found","Date not found"]

Now generate all dates from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 for both sections, following these rules:

Trusts:

Tax filing due date = 90 days after tax year-end

Reporting deadline = 12 months after filing due date

Corporations:

Tax filing due date = 6 months after tax year-end

Exception A: If the tax year-end is the last day of a month, the filing due date is the last day of the sixth month after.

Exception B: If the tax year-end is not the last day of a month, use the same numeric day in the sixth month after.

Reporting deadline = 12 months after filing due date

JSON Output Requirements:

Output must include two top-level keys: "trusts" and "corporations".

Arrays MUST be on one line.

Do not indent lines.

Use "YYYY-MM-DD" formatting for all dates.

Do not split arrays onto separate lines.

Do not add trailing commas.

Finally, output the entire JSON object exactly as valid JSON.
</pre>
</code>


<p>I would recommend using ChatGPT and prompts but here's the complete JSON update instructions as well:</p>

<p>The JSON file has 2 sections. 1 for trusts and 1 for corporations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/json/doaction-dates-en.json">https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/json/doaction-dates-en.json</a></p>

<p>There's basically 3 columns of dates.</p>

<p>Column 1: Tax year end and is what is shown in the date picker.</p>

<p>The other 2 will be dates in relation to what is selected.</p>

<p>These dates will be different between trusts and corporations.</p>


<h4>Trusts</h4>

<p>For trusts it is straight forward.</p>

<p><strong>Column 2:</strong> Tax filing due date: 90 days after your tax year end</p>

<p><strong>Column 3:</strong> SR&ED reporting deadline: 12 months after your tax filing due date</p>

<p><strong>ONLY</strong> exception is leap years (there will not be a 29th in the next year)</p>


<h4>Corporations</h4>

<p>For corporations is there is one notable exception explained below.</p>

<p><strong>Column 2:</strong> Tax filing due date: 6 months after your tax year end</p>

<p><strong>Column 3:</strong> SR&ED reporting deadline: 12 months after your tax filing due date</p>

<p>When the corporation's tax year <strong><u>ends on the last</u> day of a month</strong>, the return should be filed by the <strong>last day of the sixth month</strong> after the end of the tax year.</p>

<p>When the last day of the tax year is <strong><u>not the last</u> day of a month</strong>, the return should be filed by the <strong>same day of the sixth month</strong> after the end of the tax year.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/filing-requirements-policy.html#toc86">https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/filing-requirements-policy.html#toc86</a></p>

<p>What this means is if the tax end year is on the 30th then 6 months later if that month has 31 days then that is the tax filing due day. Or vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Ex. 1</strong></p>

<p>Year end date: 2023-03-31<br>
Tax filing due date: 2023-09-30<br>
SR&ED reporting deadline: 2024-09-30

<p><strong>Ex. 2</strong></p>

<p>Year end date: 2022-09-30<br>
Tax filing due date: 2023-03-31<br>
SR&ED reporting deadline: 2024-03-31</p>
