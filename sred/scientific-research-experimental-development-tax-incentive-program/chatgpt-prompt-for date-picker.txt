I have a JSON file with two top-level sections: "trusts" and "corporations".
Each section contains many date keys in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

For each date, the value must be one line only, formatted exactly like this:

"2024-01-02" : ["2024-04-01","2025-04-01"]

No multi-line arrays.

The first row in each section must ALWAYS be:

"bad-date" : ["Date not found","Date not found"]

Now generate all dates from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 for both sections, following these rules:

Trusts:

Tax filing due date = 90 days after tax year-end

Reporting deadline = 12 months after filing due date

Corporations:

Tax filing due date = 6 months after tax year-end

Exception A: If the tax year-end is the last day of a month, the filing due date is the last day of the sixth month after.

Exception B: If the tax year-end is not the last day of a month, use the same numeric day in the sixth month after.

Reporting deadline = 12 months after filing due date

JSON Output Requirements:

Output must include two top-level keys: "trusts" and "corporations".

Arrays MUST be on one line.

Do not indent lines.

Use "YYYY-MM-DD" formatting for all dates.

Do not split arrays onto separate lines.

Do not add trailing commas.

Finally, output the entire JSON object exactly as valid JSON.
