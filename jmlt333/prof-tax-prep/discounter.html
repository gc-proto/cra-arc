</ul>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
  <p>Professional tax preparers can offer discounting services and give you a discounted tax refund. This is where your refund is calculated, and immediatley part of it is paid to you before your tax return is filed.</p>

         





      
    
        <h2>What to expect from a discounter</h2>
             <p>A discounter preparing your tax return <strong>must</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list">
         <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>Immediately pay you the discounted tax refund</li>
              <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>Give you a completed and signed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc71.html">Form RC71, Statement of Discounting Transaction</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The discounter must also give you a copy of your tax return and any related information slip(s) if you ask for them.</p>

         <p>After the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has processed your tax return, the discounter will receive your notice of assessment (NOA) or notice of reassessment (NOR), as well as any refund. The discounter <strong>must</strong> immediately send you:</p>
<ul>
         <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc72.html">Form RC72, Notice of the Actual Amount of the Refund of Tax</a></li>
              <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The NOA or NOR received</li>
</ul>

<p>If the refund amound is $10 or more than the refund the discounter calculated, they <strong>must</strong> pay you the full amount of any difference, excluding any refund interest.</p>
  

         
<h3>Discounter fees</h3>
 
         <p>The fee a discounter can charge is the difference between your calculated refund and the refund amount paid to you. Discounters must pay you at least 85 cents for each dollar of the first $300 of an estimated refund, plus 95 cents for each remaining dollar.</p>
       
         <p mrgn-tp-lg>The following table shows examples of refund amounts and the discounter fee that would be deducted from your refund.</p>
