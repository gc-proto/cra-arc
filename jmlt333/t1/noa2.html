  <p>If your notice indicates you have a balance owing but you already paid your amount, it may be because your notice was issued before your payment was received.</p>
  <p>Tax returns that are filed online are generally assessed so quickly that any payments sent with a return may not show up on a notice.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/confirm-payment.html">confirm that we have received the payment</a> for the balance owing on your tax return.</p>
</details>
<h4>If you think your amount is incorrect</h4>
<p>If you think your amount is incorrect, review the information in the "Tax assessment" portion of your notice.</p>
