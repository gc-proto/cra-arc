    <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Getting your notice of assessment (NOA)</h1>
   <p>Your notice of assessment (NOA) is an evaluation of your personal income tax return that the CRA sends you every year after you file your return.</p>
	  <p>[Your notice of reassessment (NOR) is an evaluation of changes made to your personal income tax return.]</p>
	

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr">
<li>     
<h3>Know how long it takes</h3>
<p>How you file your tax return will affect when you get your NOA.</p>
<p>As long as you send your tax return <strong>on or before</strong> the filing due date, we will process it and typically send you your NOA within the following timelines:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-xs">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">
<h4>Online filing</h4>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="far fa-clock fa-li"></span><strong>Processing time: </strong> Within 2 weeks</li>

</ul>
	<details class="mrgn-tp-lg">
		<summary>Express NOA</summary>
		<p>You may get .....</p>
		<p>For more information, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/about-express-noa.html"><mark>Express NOA</mark></a></p>
	</details>
	
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> 	
<h4>Paper filing</h4>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="far fa-clock fa-li"></span><strong>Processing time: </strong> Within 8 weeks</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">Your NOA may take <strong>longer to process</strong>:</p>
	<details>
<summary>If your tax return is a complex tax situation</summary>
<p>Some tax filing situations are more complex and will require additional verification.</p>
		
<p>Complex tax filing situations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple tax returns</li>
<li>An international or non-resident, or emigrant return</li>
<li>A bankruptcy return</li>
<li>A deceased taxpayer return</li>
<li>A request from the CRA to you or your authorized representative for more information or documents</li>
</ul>
		<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-tp-lg">
	<li><span class="far fa-clock fa-li"></span><strong>Processing time: </strong> Approximately within 16 weeks</li>
	
</ul>
<details class="mrgn-tp-lg">
	<summary id="concur">Concurrent evaluations for multiple year tax returns</summary>
<p>If you file several consecutive-year returns at the same time, we will do a concurrent assessment. For example, if you file your 2023, 2022, and 2021 returns together.</p>
	<p>If you send us new information that changes your returns for several consecutive years, we will do a concurrent reassessment.
