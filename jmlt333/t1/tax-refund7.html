<h4>Transferring your refund to an instalment account</h4> 
<p>If you requested to have your refund transferred when you filed your return, the CRA will put the <strong>full amount</strong> in your 2025 instalment account. This amount will be applied toward any tax owing and will be considered received on the date your return is assessed. You can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/individual-payments/income-tax-instalments/how-pay.html#toc1">confirm if your instalment payment was received</a>.</p>
