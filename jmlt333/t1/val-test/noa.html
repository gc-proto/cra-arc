<p>A <strong>notice of assessment (NOA)</strong> is the summary of the calculated amounts for your income tax and benefit return. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) sends you these results after receiving your tax return.</p>
<p>The CRA will <strong>only</strong> send you a notice of reassessment (NOR) if changes are made to your assessed tax return. The NOR is an updated summary of the changes.</p>

<h2 id="rec">How you will receive your notice</h2>
           <p>The results of your notice are the same regardless of how you receive it. Notices are issued in only one language based on your preference when you filed.

	
	<p class="mrgn-bttm-md">The CRA will send your notice (NOA or NOR) in the following ways:</p>
	
	<dl class="dl-horizontal">
		<dt>In tax software</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>You have the option to view your notice in tax software immediately after you send the tax return to the CRA.</p>
			  <p>You can save or print your notice. This notice will have the <strong>same results</strong> as the copies sent by mail and in your CRA account.</p>

		</dd>
<dt>In your online CRA account</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Your notice is available in your account once your return is processed. In most situations, this will happen immediately.</p>
			<p>To view your notice, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">sign in to your CRA account</a>.</p>
			<p>If you do not have an account, you can register for one to easily access and view your notice.</p>

		<dt>Delivery by mail</dt>
			
			<dd>
			<p>The CRA sends you online mail unless you set your preferences to letter mail, or if you have never provided us with your email address.</p>
			<p><strong>Online mail in your CRA account</strong></p>
			      <p>If you provided us with an email address, you will get an email to notify you when there is mail in your CRA account.</p>
     <p>You will not receive your notice (NOA or NOR) by letter mail.</p>
				<p><strong>Letter mail</strong></p>
		
			  <p>Your notice (NOA or NOR) is sent to the mailing address on file.</p>
   <p>You can also view your notice in your CRA account, but you will not be notified by email.</p>
	
		</dd>

<h3>When you will receive your notice</h3>
	<p>The method you use to file a tax return affects how long it takes to receive your NOA. </p>
	<ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="far fa-clock fa-li"></span><strong>Standard processing time:</strong>
     <ul>
	     <li>Within 2 weeks if you filed electronically</li>
	     <li>Within 8 weeks if you filed by paper</li>
     </ul>
      </li></ul>	
<details class="mrgn-tp-lg">
	<summary>Why an NOA may take longer to issue</summary>
	  <p>It may take longer to issue an NOA if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You filed your return after the due date</li>
    <li>CRA completes a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra.html">review of your tax return</a></li>
    <li>You are filing:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple tax returns</li>
      <li>A bankruptcy return</li>
      <li>A deceased taxpayer return</li>
     
    </ul>
	  <li>The CRA requested more information or documents from you or your authorized representative</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Non-resident tax returns may take up to 16 weeks to process.</p>

  <p class="mrgn-tp-md">For details, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">CRA processing times</a>.</p>

</details>	
<details>
  <summary>How long it takes to issue a NOR after changes are made to a tax return</summary>
	<p>Generally, the processing time for issuing an NOR is the same as for an NOA.</p>
<p>If you make changes to your tax return after you have filed it, refer to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/jmlt333/t1/val-test/change-return.html#how">how long it takes to process your adjustment request</a>.</p>
<p>If the CRA found errors on the tax return you filed, you will receive your NOR right after our reassessment is complete.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Concurrent assessments and reassessments</summary>
  <p>If you file several consecutive-year returns at the same time, we will do a concurrent assessment. For example, if you file your 2024, 2023, and 2022 returns together, we will assess all your returns at the same time. The result appears in the account summary on the last notice of the series.</p>
  <p>If you provide us with new information that changes your returns for several consecutive years, we will do a concurrent reassessment.</p>

      <h4>Available contribution room</h4>

      <h4>Excess contribution</h4>
      <p>If your RRSP contributions are more than your deduction limit, you have an excess of contributions. You may have to pay tax on this amount.</p>
