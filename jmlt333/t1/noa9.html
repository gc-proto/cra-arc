  <summary>Concurrent assessments and reassessments</summary>
  <p>If you file several consecutive-year returns at the same time, we will do a concurrent assessment.

  <p>If you provide us with new information that changes your returns for several consecutive years, we will do a concurrent reassessment.</p>

    <p>If you file several consecutive-year returns at the same time, we will do a concurrent assessment. For example, if you file your 2023, 2022, and 2021 returns together, we will assess all your returns at the same time. The result appears in the account summary on the last notice of the series.</p>
    <p>If you provide us with new information that changes your returns for several consecutive years, we will do a concurrent reassessment.</p>
