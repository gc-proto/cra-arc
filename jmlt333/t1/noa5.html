<p>A <b>notice of assessment (NOA)</b> is the summary of the calculated amounts for your personal income tax and benefits return. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) sends you a NOA after receiving your completed tax return.</p>
<p>The CRA will send you a <b>notice of reassessment (NOR)</b> if you make changes to your tax return after you have filed it. You will also receive a NOR if the CRA found errors on the tax return you filed. The NOR shows a summary of the recalculated amounts made to your tax return.</p>

  <h4>Processing a tax return</h4>
  <p>It may take longer to process a tax return and issue a <strong>notice of assessment (NOA)</strong> if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You filed your return after the due date</li>
    <li>CRA completes a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra.html">review of your tax return</a></li>

      <li>A request from the CRA to you or your authorized representative for more information or documents</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Non-resident tax returns may take up to 16 weeks to process.</p>
  <h4>Processing adjustment requests</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Multiple tax returns</li>
    <li>Tax years beyond the normal 3-year reassessment period</li>
    <li>A bankruptcy return</li>
