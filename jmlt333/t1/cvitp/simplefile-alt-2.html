    <p>SimpleFile is a tax filing service offered by the CRA, which allows eligible individuals to file their <strong>2024 income tax and benefit return</strong>. The service targets individuals with a lower income or a fixed income, and a simple tax situation that remains unchanged from year to year. 
	<details>
		<summary>If you are a Quebec resident</summary>
		  <p>The SimpleFile service options <strong>only</strong> complete the federal tax return. You will still need to complete and submit a Quebec provincial tax return with <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="h-4">Ways to SimpleFile</h2>
              <p>To complete your tax return, the SimpleFile services use the information in CRA's systems at the time of use of the service. Once your return has been assessed, you will receive a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/notice-assessment-understand.html">notice of assessment (NOA)</a></p>
