             <p>SimpleFile services are tax filing methods for eligible individuals with a lower-income income, and a simple tax situation. These services are <strong>offered by invitation only.</strong></p>
<p>With SimpleFile services, you only need to answer a series of quick questions, and then the services use your answers and the information the CRA has on file, to complete and process an income tax and benefit return on your behalf. Once your return has been assessed, you will receive a <a href="">notice of assessment (NOA)</a>.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="h-4">Ways to SimpleFile</h2>
    <p>To complete your income tax and benefit return, the SimpleFile services use the information in CRA's systems at the time of use of the service.
