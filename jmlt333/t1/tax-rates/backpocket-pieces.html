<h3>If your location differs from the location of your income source</h3>
	  <p>There may be additional considerations if the location where you reside is different from the location of your income source.</p>
<details>
	<summary>If you live in one province or territory and work in a different province or territory</summary>
	 <p>Most employers will consider you a resident in the region which you work when deducting provincial or territorial tax from your pay. </p>
    <p>You are <strong>also</strong> required to pay provincial or territorial taxes where you reside. </p>
    <p>For example, an Ontario resident working in Quebec will generally have their pay taxed following Quebecâ€™s provincial taxes. They must also pay Ontario provincial taxes when filing their Income Tax and Benefit Return. </p>
 
</details>
<details>
	<summary>If you live outside of Canada but have income from Canada</summary>
	 <p>Depending on your residency status, the type of income you incurred, and the type of return being filed, the taxes you owe will vary.</p>
    <p>For example, you may have to pay a surtax instead of a provincial or territorial tax.</p>

<h3>Increase tax deductions from your income</h3>
	<p>You can request to increase tax deductions to reduce your tax payable.</p>
<details>
	<summary>If you receive a paycheque</summary>
	 <p>Generally, most employers will deduct tax directly from your pay. You can choose to have more tax deducted from your pay by completing <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/td1-personal-tax-credits-returns.html">Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Returns</a> and providing it to your employer.</p>
	<p>If you have more than one job, you must select the box "More than one employer or payer at the same time" on each Form TD1 you fill out for your employers.</p>

<details>
	<summary>If you receive pension payments</summary>
	   <p>If you are <strong>60 years or older</strong> and receive Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments or Old Age Security (OAS) payments, taxes are <strong>not</strong> automatically deducted. If you want taxes deducted from these payments, you can make a request.</p>
      <p>For information on how to deduct federal income tax from your pension payments, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/after-apply.html#h2.3">CPP taxes</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/old-age-security/while-receiving.html#h2.3">OAS payments</a>.</p>
