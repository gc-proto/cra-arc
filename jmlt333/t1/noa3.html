<p>The CRA will send you a <b>notice of reassessment (NOR)</b> if either you or the CRA make changes to your tax return after you have filed it. The NOR shows a summary of the recalculated amounts made to your tax return.</p>

<h3>Notice of assessment or Notice of reassessment</h3> 
<p>The Commissioner of Revenue outlines your assessment or reassessment result, and calculated balance. If you are getting a refund, the amount and your chosen method for payments is indicated.</p> 
<p>If you have a balance owing, the amount you must pay and the due date is provided.</p>
<h3>Account summary</h3>
<p>This section shows the result of your assessed or reassessed tax return.</p> 
<p>The amount may include outstanding balances you may owe from previous returns. If you send tax returns or provide new information that impact consecutive years, the account summary may also show the result from <u>concurrent evaluations</u>[?].</p> 
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>A refund</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you are getting a refund, the amount of your refund is displayed.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>A balance owing</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If you owe income taxes, the amount you owe and your payment due date is provided. To avoid interest charges you need to pay by the payment due date.</p>
    <p>Refer to:<a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/jmlt333/t1/balance-owing2.html">Paying the balance owing on your personal income tax</a> </p>
  </dd> 
  <dt>No refund or balance owing</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If your balance is “Nil”. This means the balance on your return is $0. You do not owe any amount to the CRA and the CRA does not need to send you a refund.</p>
    <p>You may also have a “Nil” balance if you paid your balance in full before your notice was issued.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<details>
  <summary>Why your notice is showing a balance owing even after you have paid</summary>
  <p>If your notice indicates you have a balance owing, but you have already paid, it may be because your notice was issued before your payment was received.</p>
  <p>Tax returns filed online are generally assessed so quickly that any payments sent with a return may not show up by the time you receive your notice.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/confirm-payment.html">confirm that we have received the payment</a> for the balance owing on your tax return.</p>
</details>
<h4>If you think your refund or balance owing is incorrect</h4>
<p>If you think your amount is incorrect, review the information in the "Tax assessment" portion of your notice.</p>
<p>If you find any errors, refer to: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/jmlt333/t1/change-return2.html">
