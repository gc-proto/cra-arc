         <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Using electronic signatures  TESTING</h1>

<p>An electronic signature is an efficient way to provide consent and declare information given on forms exchanged between third parties is correct and complete.</p>
	      <p>Whether a signature is paper-based or electronic, the purpose is to link a person to a document (or transaction), and typically provides evidence of that person’s intent to approve or to be bound by its contents. </p>
	      

	      
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows taxpayers and third parties to use an electronic signature on the following forms:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t183.html">T183, Information Return for Electronic Filing of an Individual’s Income Tax and Benefit Return</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t183corp.html">T183CORP, Information Return for Corporations Filing Electronically</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t183trust.html">T183TRUST, Information Return for the Electronic Filing of a Trust Return</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2200.html">T2200, Declaration of Conditions of Employment</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1223.html">T1223, Clergy Residence Deduction</a></li>
	      </ul>
<p>It is the taxpayer's choice whether they would like to sign these forms traditionally or apply an electronic signature.</p>

	<p>Available February 2024:</p>
	      <ul>
		         <li>RC71, Statement of Discounting Transaction</li>
		         <li>RC72, Notice of the Actual Amount of the Refund of Tax</li>
		      
	      </ul>


	      <h2>Applying electronic signatures to forms</h2>
<p>In order for the CRA to accept the use of electronic signatures between third parties on these forms, it is expected that identity verification has been performed by the party <strong>receiving</strong> the signed form.</p> 
	      <p>The electronic signature that is incorporated in, attached to, or associated with the form must meet conditions depending on how it is applied.</p>
	      
	      
	      <p>If an electronic signature is applied to a form <strong>in person</strong> by the individual, it <strong>must</strong> be applied in the presence of the other party using a method such as writing with a stylus or a finger on a tablet.</p>	  
	  <p>If an electronic signature is <strong>not</strong> applied to a form <strong>in person</strong> by the individual, it <strong>must</strong> be applied to the form that is then sent to the other party by either:</p>    

	      <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-xs">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
   

    <p>Using the electronic address most recently provided to the other party for that purpose</p>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">


    <p>Through an access controlled, secured, electronic location, such as a secure website, that is accessible to the individual only because the other party has made that location known and granted access to the individual</p>
	 
	   </li>
</ul>  


	      
<h3>Masking social insurance numbers (SIN)</h3>
<p>To ensure the safety and security of personal and tax information, the CRA highly recommends that the first 5 digits of a SIN be masked on forms. The CRA follows this practice when generating or displaying notices and statements that contain a SIN.</p>
        
	   <h2>Electronic signatures in certified tax software</h2>   
	      
	      <p>EFILE certified software may include electronic signature solutions developed in-house or they may contain third party solutions. Electronic filers can also offer signature solutions of their choice that operate or function independently of EFILE software. </p>
	      <p>Certain forms may include a date-and-time stamp:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>YY/MM/DD (year/month/day)</li>
		       <li>HH/MM/SS (hour/minute/second)</li>
	      </ul>
	 <p>The CRA will accept a date-and-time stamp that has been automatically populated by the software or manually entered by the taxpayer or electronic filer. </p>

<p>Due to the variety of electronic signature solutions available, with each having their own default settings for displaying date and time, electronic filers may need to adjust the document formatting settings within their electronic signature service account to ensure that the date and time are displayed on the electronically signed form. </p>
<p>There are a variety of electronic signature solutions available, and because each have their own default setting for displaying date and time, electronic filers may need to adjust the settings within their electronic signature service account to ensure that the date and time are displayed on the electronically signed form.</p>	      
	 <p>Adjustments to settings may be needed whether the electronic signature solution is integrated into the software, or if it operates independently. </p>
	      <h3>Certificate of completion</h3>
	  <p>Third party electronic signature services may also provide a certificate of completion for the electronic signature. </p>
	      <p>Electronic filers should keep this certificate together with the electronically signed forms in case the CRA request them as part of our monitoring program.</p>
	      <p>Keeping these certificates of completion will be especially important in the event that the electronically signed copy of the forms do not display the timestamp of the electronic signature. </p>
