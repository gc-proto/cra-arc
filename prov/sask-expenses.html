        <h2 id="howmuch">How much you can claim</h2>
            <p>The Saskatchewan Home Renovation Tax Credit helps offset the cost of home renovations. You can claim renovation costs <b>over $1,000,</b> and up to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$12,000 for the 2021 tax year</li>
                <li>$10,000 for the 2022 tax year</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The base amount of $1,000 is <b>subtracted</b> from your claim. That means if your costs were $10,000, you would claim $9,000.</p>
            
        
            <h2 id="elig">Eligibility</h2>
             <h3 id="who">Who the credit is for</h3>
        <p>The credit is available to people who renovated their principal residence located in Saskatchewan. You or your family must have lived at the residence during the time of the renovation.</p>
   
      
<p>For the purposes of the credit, a family is defined as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an individual</li>
            <li>a spouse or common-law partner</li>
            <li>their children who were under the age of 18 years at the end of year for which the credit is claimed</li>
        </ul>
<p>More than one family member can claim credits separately. Eligible expenditures not claimed by one family member can be claimed by another family member. The total amount claimed by all family members can not exceed the maximum of $12,000 for 2021 or $10,000 for 2022.</p>

<h4>Special conditions</h4>

<h5>Joint ownership</h5>
 <p>When two or more families share the ownership of an eligible dwelling, each family can claim a separate  amount based on their respective eligible expenditures. The maximum amount of eligible expenses is applied to each family making the claim.</p>
            
        <details>
            <summary><b>Example: Renovations of a jointly owned home</b></summary>
            <p>
            Olga and her brother, Sven, jointly own a house. Olga paid $14,000 and Sven paid $11,000 to renovate the bathroom and the kitchen in June 2021. Because Sven and Olga are adult siblings, they are considered 2 separate families. They will use these calculations: 
            </p>    
                <h4><b>Olga's claim</b></h4>
                <p> Total costs incurred: $14,000</p>
                <p> Total eligible expenses (for the 2021 tax year): $12,000</p>
                <p> Subtract the base amount: -$1,000</p>
                <p> Home Renovation expenses: <b>$11,000</b></p>

                <h4><b>Sven's claim</b></h4>
                <p  >Total costs incurred: $11,000</p>
                <p> Total eligible home renovation expenses <br/> (for the 2021 tax year): $11,000</p>
                <p> Subtract the base amount: -$1,000</p>
                <p> Home Renovation expenses: <b>$10,000</b></p>

                <p>As Olga’s renovation expenses exceed the $12,000 maximum eligible expenses for 2021, the full $14,000 she paid is limited to a maximum amount of $12,000 for 2022.</p>
            </details>

<h5>Owning a share in a co-operative housing corporation</h5>
<p>You can also claim the credit if you do not own the property you renovated, but you own a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation. To qualify, you must have acquired the share solely to get the right to live in the housing unit owned by that corporation.</p>

<h3 id="when">When costs were incurred</h3>
<p>Renovations must have been carried out and largely completed during the tax year when they are claimed.</p>
<p>For the 2021 tax year you must have incurred qualified expenses between:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>October 1, 2020</strong> and <strong>December 31, 2021</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For the 2022 tax year you must have incurred qualified expenses between:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>January 1, 2022 </strong> and <strong>December 31, 2022</strong></li>
</ul>

<details>
    <summary><b>Example: Costs over the limit in the 2021 tax year </b></summary>
    <p>Jan and Naya bought an energy-efficient furnace in November 2020. They paid $15,000 for the furnace and installation. They will use these calculations:</p>

        <p>Total costs incurred: $15,000</p>
        <p>Eligible expenses (for the 2021 tax year): $12,000</p>
        <p>Subtract the base amount: -$1,000</p>
        <p>Home Renovation expenses: $11,000</p>

        <p>As Jan and Naya’s combined renovation expenses exceed the $12,000 maximum for 2021, they cannot claim the full $15,000 paid. They are limited to a maximum of $11,000 for 2021.</p>

        <p>Either Jan or Naya can claim the entire amount of $11,000, or they can each claim a portion of the expenses. Either way, the total amounts claimed can not exceed $11,000.</p>
        
    </p>
    </details>

<h3 id="prop">Eligible property types</h3>
<p>To be eligible, a dwelling must be your <b>principal residence</b>. More than one dwelling may be eligible if your principal residence changed during the year, but the total of the eligible expenses cannot exceed the allowable maximum. Eligible dwellings can include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>houses</li>
    <li>cottages</li>
    <li>condominium units</li>
    <li>a share in a co-operative housing corporation </li>
</ul>

<h4>Special conditions</h4>

<h5>Condominiums and co-operative housing corporations</h5>
<p>You can claim the credit for:</p>
 
<ul>
    <li>eligible expenditures incurred to renovate the unit that is your principal residence</li>
    <li>expenses from <b>your share</b> of the cost of eligible expenditures incurred in common areas</li>
</ul>

	<h5>Properties used for business or rental income</h5>
<p>If you earn business or rental income from part of your principal residence, you can claim:</p>
 
<ul>
    <li>the <b>full cost</b> of renovations to areas used <b>only</b> for personal use</li>
    <li>a <b>portion</b> of costs for renovations to areas that benefit the property as a whole (for example, re-shingling a roof) equal to the proportion used for personal use only</li>
</ul>

<details>
    <summary><b>Example: Home office </b></summary>
    <p>Noor owns a house, and runs her business out of a home office. She had the exterior of the house painted, which cost $4,000.</p>

        <p></p>Noor’s office occupies 10% of her total house space, so she can claim:

        <p>Cost of renovation: $4,000</p>
        <p>Portion used by her business: $4,000 x 10% = $400</p>
        <p>Eligible expenses: $4,000 - $400 = $3,600</p>
        <p>Subtract base amount: -$1,000</p>
        <p>Home Renovation expenses: $2,600</p>

        <p>Since Noor runs a business out of her home, she cannot claim the total amount of her expenses.</p> 

    </p>
    </details>

    <h3 id="expen">Eligible and ineligible renovation expenses</h3>
    <p>Eligible expenditures must be incurred in relation to a renovation or alteration of your eligible dwelling. This can include land that forms part of the eligible dwelling. The renovation or alteration must be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>of an enduring nature</li>
        <li>integral to the eligible dwelling</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can claim expenses for costs of materials as well as the cost of hiring others to do the work (such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, or architects).</p>

    <p>Be sure to <a href="#keep">keep your receipts and other documentation.</a></p>

<h5>Window coverings</h5>
<p>To qualify for the credit, window coverings must have become part of the home.</p>
<p>This can include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>blinds</li>
    <li>shutters</li>
    <li>shades</li>
</ul>

<p>The coverings must be directly attached to the window frame, so that removing them would alter the nature of the dwelling. They would then be considered to be fixtures, and so qualify for the Home Renovation Tax Credit.</p>
<p>Draperies and curtains generally would not qualify for the credit. However they may qualify if they would not keep their value or usefulness if installed in another dwelling.</p>


<h3 id="rel">Expenses paid to a relative</h3>
<p>Expenses are not eligible if the goods or services are provided by a person related to you, unless that person is registered for the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) under the Excise Tax Act.</p>

<p>If your family member is registered for GST/HST and if all other conditions are met, the expenses <b>are eligible</b> for the Home Renovation Tax Credit.</p>

<h2 id="howto">How to claim the credit</h2>
<p>The Saskatchewan Home Renovation expenses form will be available for the 2022 tax season.</p>

<p>Please check back shortly as a link will be provided here.</p>

<h3 id="keep">Keep receipts and other documentation</h3>
<p>Keep track of your expenses during the renovation and keep a copy of acceptable documentation, such as agreements, invoices, and receipts. They must clearly identify dates, costs, and the type and quantity of goods purchased or services provided. For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>information that clearly identifies the vendor or contractor, their business address and, if applicable, the GST/HST registration number</li>
    <li>a description of the goods and the date when the goods were purchased</li>
    <li>the date when the goods were delivered (keep your delivery slip as proof) and/or when the work or services were performed</li>
    <li>a description of the work performed including the address where the work was performed</li>
    <li>the amount of the invoice</li>
    <li>proof of payment (receipts and invoices) – invoices must indicate “paid” or be accompanied by other proof of payment, such as a credit card slip or cancelled cheques</li>
    <li>a statement from the co-operative housing corporation or condominium corporation signed by an authorized individual. This statement should identify:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>the amounts incurred for the renovation or alteration work</li>
        <li>as a condominium owner, your portion of those expenses if the work is performed on common areas of the condominium</li>
        <li>information that clearly identifies the vendor or contractor, their business address and, if applicable, their GST/HST registration number</li>
        <li>a description of the work performed and the dates when the work or services were performed.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to include the documentation with your claim, but you must keep it in case we ask to see it. </p>
