         <h4>Speak to us if you disagree with one of our decisions</h4>
<p>Disagreements can be caused by a lack of information or by simple miscommunication. Before you send an objection or appeal a CRA decision, contact us to obtain an explanation of your notice. Also, if you have a new or additional information, you can request an adjustment. However, talking to us will not delay the deadline for sending an objection or an appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Interest charges will continue to accumulate during this period.</strong> In circumstances that are specified in legislation, such as when an amount is in jeopardy, the CRA can take collection action even though an objection or an appeal has <span class="nowrap">been sent</span>.</p>
<p>After talking to us, you may not be satisfied with our explanation, or you may think we have misinterpreted the facts or we have not applied the law correctly. If you find yourself in one of these situations, you have a legislated right to object, appeal, or request a <span class="nowrap">second–level</span> review of your concern. Objections, appeals, and reviews may deal with such <span class="nowrap">things as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>income tax assessments and reassessments</li>
<li>Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance assessments and rulings</li>
<li>goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (<span class="nowrap">GST/HST</span>) assessments and reassessments</li>
<li>determinations and re-determinations of the <span class="nowrap">GST/HST</span> credit, the Canada Child Benefit and the Universal Child Care <span class="nowrap">Benefit<br></span></li>
<li>taxpayer relief requests and voluntary disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about what to do in specific situations, to find out how to send an objection or an appeal, or to ask for a <span class="nowrap">second–level</span> review, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes.html">Service feedback, objections, appeals, disputes, and relief measures</a> or <span class="nowrap"><a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a></span>.</p>

    
        <h4>To make sure our review processes are impartial</h4>
<p>Officers at the CRA are responsible for carrying out complete, professional, and impartial reviews of disputes. Such disputes can arise as a result of administrative decisions, assessments of income tax, excise tax, GST/HST, Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance rulings and assessments, and assessments under the Air Travellers Security Charge Act and the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006.</p>
<p>The officer responsible for handling your file will not have been involved with the original decision under dispute. This independent review <span class="nowrap">will involve the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>applying acts administered by the CRA and reviewing CRA policies</li>
<li>considering your point of view</li>
<li>when necessary, asking for a technical opinion from CRA experts or from the Department of Justice</li>
</ul>
<p>The officer assigned to your file will conduct a preliminary review of the facts and issues relevant to your situation. As part of this review, you or your authorized representative may be contacted to discuss the issues in dispute and to get more documents and details. You will also be offered copies of material the CRA is relying on to support its position. The officer will then consider the information and make a decision.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the decision reached by the officer, you can appeal or seek a judicial review of that decision from the appropriate court or, for certain matters, to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.</p>

        <h4>Cancel or waive penalties or interest</h4>
<p>The CRA administers legislation, commonly called the taxpayer relief provisions, that gives the CRA discretion to cancel or waive penalties or interest when taxpayers are unable to meet their tax obligations due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p>The CRA’s discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ended within 10 calendar years before the year in which a request is made.</p>
<p>For penalties, the CRA will consider your request only if it relates to a tax year or fiscal period ending in any of the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2022 must relate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending in 2012 or later.</p>
<p>For interest on a balance owing for any tax year or fiscal period, the CRA will consider only the amounts that accumulated during the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2022 must relate to interest that accumulated in 2012 or later.</p>
<p>To make a request, fill out <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form RC4288, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest</a>. For more information about relief from penalties or interest and how to submit your request, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/taxpayer-relief-provisions.html">Taxpayer relief provisions</a>.</p>

       <p>Service standards are the basis of our performance management system and represent our public commitment to the level of service you can expect from us under normal circumstances.</p>

 <p>We set targets for achieving each service standard based on operational realities and infrastructure, available resources, historical performance, degree of complexity of the work, and Canadians’ expectations.</p>

 <p>We regularly revise our service standards to make sure they are up-to-date and relevant. When our performance results drop significantly below targets, it is a signal to us to take action.</p>

 <p>We measure our performance against our service standards and publish the results in our departmental results report, which is tabled in Parliament every year. You can see this report by going to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information.html">CRA reports</a>.</p>

          <h4>Cracking down on abusive tax schemes</h4>
<p>We try to provide information that will help you understand how to protect yourself against questionable tax schemes and the consequences of participating in them. We take a number of steps to crack down on abusive tax schemes. For example, we sign agreements with international and domestic partners to exchange information, we use new technologies and other techniques to track and identify promoters and users of tax schemes, and we combine our expertise into special centres to better tackle complex tax schemes.</p>

      <h4>Protect yourself</h4>
<p>Our Tax Alert initiative provides you with information about enforcement activities, as well as warnings about tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes. Protect yourself against these schemes, and learn about the consequences of participating in them by going to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/news/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/tax-alert.html"><span class="nowrap">Tax Alert</span></a>.</p>

	<p>We believe that we can help reduce the costs small businesses incur to pay their taxes by simplifying and reducing the frequency of their interactions with us, and by improving our communications with them.
