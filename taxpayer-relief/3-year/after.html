  <p>Once  the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has started reviewing your request, we may  contact you if we need help understanding what you provided, or to get any  missing information.</p>
  <p>In all  cases, once we have finished our review, we will notify you, in writing, of our  decision. Your request may be approved, partially approved, or denied. If your  request is partially approved or denied, our letter will advise you on what you  can do if you do not agree with our decision.</p>
  <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#h-1">If your request is approved</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h-2">If your request is denied</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="h-1">If your request is approved</h2>
  <p>Depending on your situation, any of the following may happen if your request is approved:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>Refund</summary>
        <p>You may receive a refund of your overpayment of tax because of the reassessment or redetermination.</p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>Reduce the amount of your refund</summary>
        <p>The CRA may reduce the amount of your refund if the adjustment results in an increase of taxes, interest, or penalties. Under these circumstances, the CRA will usually only issue a refund for the amount that exceeds the taxes, interest, and penalties and apply the remainder to the new debt.</p>
        <p>If your Canada Child Benefit (CCB), Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), or goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GSH/HST) results in you having overpayments, your refund may be reduced accordingly.</p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>Refund interest</summary>
        <p>You are entitled to a refund if your request results in a reassessment or redetermination that either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>cancels all or part of any penalty or interest that you already paid</li>
          <li>reduces the amount of tax you owed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refund interest is compounded daily at the prescribed rates starting on the 31st day after the CRA has received complete and accurate information about your submitted request. If your request was received by filing an income tax return, refund interest will start on the 31st day after the date the return was filed.</p>
        <p>There is no interest paid on a refund for GST/HST credits, CCTB, or CCB payments made to an individual.</p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>Applying your refund to other debts</summary>
        <p>Your refund may be applied  any other amount you owe or are about to owe.</p>
        <p><strong>Exception:</strong> Any refund you are expecting from CCTB or CCB, will not be held and applied to any other debts you owe.</p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>Your refund will be held until outstanding returns are filed</summary>
        <p>Under the following Acts, your refund will not be issued, or applied to other debts until all missing returns have been filed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Income Tax Act</i></li>
          <li><i>Air Travellers Security Charge Act</i></li>
          <li><i>Excise Act, 2001</i></li>
          <li><i>Excise Tax Act</i></li>
        </ul>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more information on any of these situations, see paragraphs 90 to 99 of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic07-1/taxpayer-relief-provisions-1r1.html#s90"><span>Information Circular IC7-1R1</span></a>.</p>
  <h2 id="h-2">If your request is denied</h2>
  <p>If you believe that the CRA’s decision was not fair and reasonable or that discretion had not been properly exercised, there are recourse options available to you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="h-2-1">Second review</a> (done by CRA)</li>
    <li><a href="h-2-2">Judicial review</a> (by the Federal Court if you are dissatisfied with the results of the CRA's second review)</li>

  <p>A second review request <strong>must include</strong> the following:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> The reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, for example, not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing, misinterpreted, or not considered in their proper context</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Any relevant new documents, facts, or correspondence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the CRA to remain impartial and transparent, all officials who completed the first review will not conduct the second review.</p>
  <p>The second review is a new review and new decision. </p>
  <h3 id="h-2-2">Judicial review</h3>
  <p>If you disagree  with the decision you can apply to the Federal Court for a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/judicial-review.html">Judicial  review</a>. You have 30 days from the date you received the decision of the  second administrative review to take this action.</p>
  <p>If, after the second review, you still feel that we were not  fair and reasonable, you can apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review  of our decision. You must do this within 30 calendar days of the date you  received the decision from the second administrative review.</p>
