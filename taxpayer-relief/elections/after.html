  <p>Once the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has started reviewing your request, we may contact you if we need help understanding what you provided, or to get any missing information.</p>
  <p>In all cases, once the review of your request is complete, we will notify you of our decision, including the reason for the decision if it is only partially approved or denied.</p>
  <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#h-1">If your request is approved</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h-2">If your request is denied</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="h-1">If your request is approved</h2>
  <p>When accepted by the CRA, a late election will be considered to have been on time. For amended or revoked elections, the original election will be cancelled and  the CRA will reassess the affected returns for the tax years in question, even if the years are beyond the normal reassessment period.</p>
  <p>Any assessments or reassessments resulting from the CRA's acceptance of the request is subject to the general provisions concerning arrears interest charged on the balance owing.</p>
  <p>If your late, amended, or revoked election is accepted, you can file an objection to dispute the resulting assessment or reassessment. However, the objection is limited to issues related to that election. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/file-objection-cppei-appeal-minister.html">File an objection</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="h-2">If your request is denied</h2>
  <p>If you believe that the CRA made an error in its review, you can ask for a:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Second review (done by the CRA)</li>
    <li>Judicial review (done by the Federal Court if you still disagree after the second review the CRA did)</li>

  <p>A second review request <strong>must include</strong> the following:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> The reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, for example, not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing, misinterpreted, or not considered in their proper context</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Any relevant new documents, facts, or correspondence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the CRA to remain impartial and transparent, all officials who completed the first review will not conduct the second review.</p>
  <p>The second review is a new review and a new decision. </p>
  <h3>Judicial review</h3>
  <p>If, after the second review, you still feel that we were not fair and reasonable, you can apply to the Federal Court for a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/judicial-review.html">judicial review</a> of our decision. You must do this within 30 calendar days of the date you received the decision from the second administrative review.</p>
