<p class="h3 mrgn-tp-0">A new approach for handling certain personal tax information and benefits requests from representatives</p>
<p>Effective September 10, 2024, the CRA is updating its process. The ATIP Directorate will <b>no longer</b> process your requests for your client’s: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Income statements from the last 3 years </li>  
<li>Notices of assessment  </li>  
<li>Benefits information</li>
</ul> 
<p>Your client can get this information through <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services.html">other CRA services</a></p>

</section>
	<p>If you can’t find the information you are looking for, you can make a formal ATIP request. This process may take <b>at least 30 days</b>.</p>   
<p>There is a $5 fee for requests under the <i>Access to Information Act</i>.</p>
