<p>If you are an affected owner of a residential property in Canada on December 31, you <strong>must</strong> file a return for each residential property that you own as an affected owner.</p>
<p>If you own the residential property in more than one capacity, you would be treated as a separate person for each of your ownership capacities, if one of those capacities is either a partner of a partnership or a trustee of a trust.</p>
<p>You would also have to pay the tax unless you qualify for an exemption.</p>
