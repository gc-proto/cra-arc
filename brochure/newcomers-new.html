      <summary>What residential ties are</summary>
      <p>The most important factor to determine your residency status in Canada is whether you have established and maintain significant residential ties with Canada.</p>
      <p><strong>Significant residential ties to Canada include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>a home in Canada</li>
        <li>a spouse or common-law partner in Canada</li>
        <li>dependants in Canada</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Secondary residential ties that may be relevant include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>personal property, such as a car or furniture</li>
        <li>social ties, such as memberships in Canadian recreational organizations or ethnocultural groups</li>
        <li>economic ties, such as Canadian bank accounts or credit cards</li>
        <li>a Canadian driver's licence</li>
        <li>a Canadian passport</li>
        <li>health insurance with a Canadian province or territory </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The information above is general in nature. For more information on residential ties, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-5-international-residency/folio-1-residency/income-tax-folio-s5-f1-c1-determining-individual-s-residence-status.html">Income Tax Folio S5-F1-C1, Determining an Individual's Residence Status</a></p>

      <summary>Tax treaties</summary>
      <p>Canada has tax conventions or agreements, commonly known as tax treaties, with many countries which are designed to avoid double taxation and to prevent tax evasion.

    <h3 id="h-0b">Immigration status</h3>
    <p><strong>Your immigration status and tax filing obligations: </strong>Your immigration status tells you if you can live, work, or study in Canada. It reflects your reasons for being in Canada and the length of your stay. Unlike your residency status, it does not tell you your tax obligations. </p>
    <p><strong>Your immigration status and government payments:</strong> To receive any benefit and credit payments, you need to be a resident of Canada for income tax purposes. For some payments, you also need a valid immigration status.</p>
    <p>As a newcomer to Canada, your immigration status could be:</p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Permanent resident</dt>
      <dd> individuals who have been given permanent resident status, including permanent resident card holders or those who have received confirmation of permanent residence (document IMM5292 or IMM5688) from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)</dd>
      <dt>Protected <span class="nowrap">persons</span> (refugees)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>individuals who have been granted protected person status by IRCC or the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB)</p>
        <p>Note: Refugee claimants, those who are in the process of applying for refugee status, may be residents for tax purposes but do not hold a valid immigration status permit until their claim is approved.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Temporary resident </dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>individuals who hold permits such as study permits, work permits, visitor records, and temporary resident permits, as issued by IRCC</li>
          <li>individuals who maintain temporary resident status by applying to extend their permit before it expires</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The CRA uses your immigration and residency statuses to determine if you qualify for government payments and when you can start receiving them. For example, a temporary resident can start receiving the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html">Canada  Child Benefit (CCB)</a> payment in the 19th month they have lived in Canada, provided they continue to hold a valid permit and meet all other eligibility requirements. Make sure to update the CRA if your temporary residence permit gets renewed to keep getting payments. </p>

    <h2 id="h-0-1">Get a social insurance number (SIN) or tax number</h2>
    <p>A SIN is a nine‑digit  identification number that is unique, personal and confidential.</p>
    <p>You need a SIN to:</p>
    <ul class="list-inline">
      <li class="mrgn-rght-md"><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> receive benefit and credit payments</li>
      <li class="mrgn-rght-md"><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> work in Canada</li>
      <li class="mrgn-rght-md"><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> open most bank accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">Apply for a SIN</a> with <strong>Service Canada</strong>.</p>
    <details class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
      <summary>If Service Canada will not issue you a SIN, you may get a temporary tax number (TTN) from CRA</summary>
      <p>A TTN can be used to get benefit and credit payments, do your taxes, and sign up for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA sign-in services</a>. </p>
      <p>How to get a TTN:</p>

        <li class="cnjnctn-col-50">
          <p>Complete your benefit or credit application or tax return without a SIN. Attach a letter explaining why you do not have a SIN or can't get one.</p>

          <p>To get a TTN more quickly, you may also include <strong>certified copies</strong> of documents that prove your identity, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a passport</li>
            <li>a driver's licence</li>
            <li>a birth certificate or proof of birth</li>
            <li>an immigration document showing that your spouse is sponsoring you (if your spouse has a SIN and is sponsoring you)</li>
            <li>a letter from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a> that says they are reviewing your file</li>

    <h2 id="h-50">Canada’s tax system</h2>
    <p>Canada's tax system  is administered by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html">Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)</a>,  which oversees taxes, benefits, and related programs for the Government of  Canada and for most provinces and territories.  The tax year follows the calendar year, running  from January 1 to December 31.  Your completed tax return is usually due by April 30 of the following year.   </p>
    <p>Each year, you can determine your tax obligation by completing an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">Income  Tax and Benefit Return</a> and sending it to the CRA. On the return, you: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>report your income and claim your       deductions</li>
      <li>calculate your federal and provincial or       territorial tax</li>
      <li>determine if you&rsquo;ll get money back or owe       taxes, depending on whether enough tax was deducted from your pay during       the year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a resident of Canada for tax purposes, you are required by the law to pay an amount of tax each year based on your income and personal situation.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>When you have a job, your employer will typically deduct taxes directly from what they pay you. Employment insurance and pension providers will do the same. This means you have paid your taxes in advance or if applicable, have less to pay when you do your taxes.</p>
        <p>Each year before taxes are due, your employer or other payer will provide you and the CRA with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips.html">tax slips</a>. These slips show your income, deductions, and the amounts paid to the CRA on your behalf.  You need your tax slips to do your taxes, which means completing and filing your tax return. </p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/underground-economy.html">underground  economy</a> includes any activity not reported for income tax  and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html">GST/HST </a> purposes. It is sometimes called &quot;working under the table&quot; and can  include unreported or underreported income from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>tips and gratuities received in addition to your regular income</li>
        <li>employment income not reported on a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips.html">tax slip</a></li>
        <li>business income not reported on a tax slip, including self-employed individuals providing services without a registered business number</li>
        <li>earning extra income on the side of your full-time work (for       example, by renting out a room or providing a ride-sharing service)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>gift cards or gifts received as  payment or incentives</li>
        <li>receiving cash payments for  goods or services</li>

        <li>the exchange of goods or services (bartering with another       individual or business) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Generally, income you earn is taxable and has to be reported on  your tax return, even if you do not receive a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4.html">T4 slip </a> and when the activity is not your main source of income.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>some require an application, while others are  automatically calculated when you do your taxes every year</li>
      <li>payments can be monthly, quarterly, or annually</li>
      <li>some are deductions on your tax return that help reduce  the amount of income tax you have to pay </li>

    <h3 id="h-1">Keep getting payments</h3>
    <p>In most cases, the CRA automatically considers you for benefit  and credit payments when you do your taxes. However, if you applied for and are receiving <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/child-and-family-benefits.html">benefit and credit</a> payments, there are things you can do  to keep getting your payments on time. </p>
    <h4>Do your taxes on time each year</h4>
    <p>The CRA uses your tax return each year to calculate your benefit  and credit payments, even if you do not owe tax, are tax-exempt, or have no  income to report.</p>
    <p>As residents for income tax purposes, you and your spouse or  common‑law partner, if applicable, have until April 30 to do your taxes for the  previous year. If you or your spouse or common‑law partner are self-employed,  the deadline to do your taxes is June 15.</p>
    <p>If you live in Quebec, you also need to  do a a provincial tax return each year with  <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu  Québec</a>.</p>
    <p>Find out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals.html">when you must file a tax return </a>and how to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax/get-ready-taxes.html">get ready to do your taxes</a>.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Doing your first tax return</summary>
      <p>As a newcomer to Canada,    there are important tax considerations you should be aware of when you do    your taxes. Along with claiming deductions, credits, and expenses, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4055/t4055-newcomers-canada.html#P111">Completing    your return for newcomers</a> to    learn more about:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>treaty-exempt income live in Quebec, you also need to file</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <h4>Keep your  information up to date</h4>
    <p> Benefit and credit  payments depend on your situation, so it's important to update the CRA as soon  as possible if there is a change. For example when a child leaves your care, you  leave  Canada, or if your immigration  status permit expires, as it must be renewed and kept up to date to continue  receiving payments. </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Update your temporary resident  permit</summary>
      <p>To keep getting CCB payments, you or your spouse or    common-law partner, if you have one, must maintain a continuous legal status    in Canada. To avoid delaying any benefit payments you qualify for, you need    to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-contact.html">send    the CRA</a> your new temporary resident permit issued by Immigration,    Refugees and Citizenship Canada before your current permit expires. If the    permit expires, your payments will stop. </p>
      <p> If you applied to extend your permit before your    existing permit expired, but have not yet received a decision from IRCC, you    are considered to have maintained status and are eligible to receive CCB    until a decision has been made. </p>
      <p> To avoid any disruption to your payments, send your new    permit or proof that you have maintained your status to the CRA.  You can do this online using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My    account</a>  or by <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/address-tax-centre-mail-your-forms.html">mailing    a copy to your tax centre</a></p>
    </details>
    <h4>Report Income  of Non-Resident Spouse or Common-Law Partner</h4>
    <p>If you are receiving  the CCB and your spouse or common-law partner was a non-resident of Canada for  all or part of the year, you need to report their income, from all sources,  that was not reported on a Canadian tax return. This is required as the CCB is  based on your family net income. </p>
