        <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) considers you a newcomer to Canada for  the <strong>first year</strong> you are a resident of Canada for income tax  purposes. </p>

        <p>In Canada, your tax obligations depend on your residency status.

        <p>Determine your residency status by <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html">following these steps</a>.</p>
        <p>You become a<strong> resident of Canada for income tax purposes</strong> when you  have enough <strong>residential ties</strong> in Canada. For most newcomers, this starts your  first day living in Canada. </p>
        <p>As a resident of Canada, you and your family can start getting benefit  and credit payments like the goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax  (GST/HST) credit, even before you file your first tax return.  You need to file  a tax return each year if you want to continue getting benefit and credit  payments, claim a refund, or if you owe tax.</p>
        <p>Your residency status in Canada may change year to year, depending on  the length and reason for your stay, if you leave temporarily or permanently,  or if you live outside of Canada for part of the year.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s important to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/update-information-cra/personal.html">keep the CRA up to date</a> on your  residency status to make sure you get the benefit and credit payments you&rsquo;re  eligible for, in the correct amounts. </p>

      <summary>What residential ties are</summary>
      <p>The most important factor to determine your residency status in Canada is whether or not you have established and maintain significant residential ties with Canada.</p>
      <p><strong>Significant residential ties to Canada include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>a home you own or lease in Canada</li>
        <li>a spouse (someone you are legally married to) or common-law partner (someone you live with in a marriage-like relationship, but are not married to) in Canada</li>
        <li>dependants in Canada</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Secondary residential ties that may be relevant include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>personal property in Canada, such as a car or furniture</li>
        <li>social ties in Canada, such as memberships in Canadian recreational organizations or ethnocultural groups</li>
        <li>economic ties in Canada, such as Canadian bank accounts or credit cards</li>
        <li>a Canadian driver's licence</li>
        <li>a Canadian passport</li>
        <li>health insurance with a Canadian province or territory </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The information above is general in nature. For more information on residential ties, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-5-international-residency/folio-1-residency/income-tax-folio-s5-f1-c1-determining-individual-s-residence-status.html">Income Tax Folio S5-F1-C1, Determining an Individual's Residence Status</a></p>

      <summary>Tax treaties</summary>
      <p>Canada has tax conventions or agreements, commonly known as tax treaties, with many countries which are designed to avoid double taxation and to prevent tax evasion.

    <h3 id="h-0b">Immigration status</h3>
    <p><strong>Your immigration status and tax filing obligations: </strong>Your immigration status tells you if you can live, work, or study in  Canada. It reflects your reasons for being in Canada and the length of your  stay, but it does not tell you about your tax filing obligations like your  residency status does. </p>
    <p><strong>Your immigration status and government payments:</strong> To receive  any benefit and credit payments, you need to be a resident of Canada for income  tax purposes. For some benefit and credit payments, you also need a valid  immigration status to qualify.</p>
    <p>As a newcomer to Canada, your immigration status could be:</p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Permanent resident</dt>
      <dd> individuals who have been given permanent resident status, including permanent resident card holders or those who have received confirmation of permanent residence (document IMM5292 or IMM5688) from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)</dd>
      <dt>Protected <span clas="nowrap">persons</span> (refugees)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>individuals who have been granted protected person status by IRCC or the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB)</p>
        <p>Note: Refugee claimants, those who are in the process of applying for refugee status, may be residents for tax purposes but do not hold a valid immigration status permit until their claim is approved.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Temporary resident </dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>individuals who hold permits such as study permits, work permits, visitor records, and temporary resident permits, as issued by IRCC</li>
          <li>individuals who maintain temporary resident status by applying to extend their permit before it expires</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Your immigration  status and residency status in Canada help the CRA determine if you qualify and  when you can start receiving payments. For  example, a temporary resident who has  lived in Canada for 18 months can start receiving <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html">Canada  Child Benefit</a> (CCB) payments in the 19th month, provided they continue  to hold a valid permit and meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

    <h2 id="h-0-1">Get a social insurance number (SIN) or tax number</h2>
    <p>A SIN is a nine‑digit  identification number that is unique, personal and confidential.</p>
    <p>You need a SIN to:</p>
    <ul class="list-inline">
      <li class="mrgn-rght-md"><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> receive benefits and credits</li>
      <li class="mrgn-rght-md"><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> work in Canada</li>
      <li class="mrgn-rght-md"><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> open most types of bank accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">Apply for a SIN</a> with <strong>Service Canada</strong>.</p>
    <details class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
      <summary>If Service Canada will not issue you a SIN, you may get a temporary tax number (TTN) from CRA</summary>
      <p>A TTN can be used to get benefit and credit payments, file taxes, and sign up for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA sign-in services</a>. </p>
      <p>How to get a TTN:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
        <li class="cnjnctn-col-50">
          <p>Complete your benefit or credit application or tax return without a SIN. Attach a letter explaining why you do not have a SIN or can't get one.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="cnjnctn-col">
          <p>To get a number faster, you may also include <strong>certified copies</strong> of documents that prove your identity, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a passport</li>
            <li>a driver's licence</li>
            <li>a birth certificate or proof of birth</li>
            <li>an immigration document showing that your spouse is sponsoring you (if your spouse has a SIN and is sponsoring you)</li>
            <li>a letter from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a> that says they are reviewing your file</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

    <h2 id="h-50">Canada’s tax system</h2>
    <p>Canada's tax system  is administered by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html">Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)</a>,  which oversees taxes, benefits, and related programs for the Government of  Canada and for most provinces and territories.  The tax year follows the calendar year, running  from January 1 to December 31.    </p>
    <p>Each year, you determine  your tax obligation by completing an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">Income  Tax and Benefit Return</a> and sending it to the CRA, usually due by April 30 of the following year.  On the return, you: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>report your income and claim your       deductions</li>
      <li>calculate your federal and provincial or       territorial tax</li>
      <li>determine if you&rsquo;ll get money back or owe       taxes, depending on whether enough tax was deducted from your pay during       the year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a resident of Canada for tax purposes, you are  responsible to pay the required amount of tax each year based on your income  and personal situation, as required by the law.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>Employers and other  payers, such as employment insurance or pension providers, usually deduct taxes  directly from the income they pay you. Individuals with business or rental  income typically pay their taxes by installment. Annually, before taxes are due,  your employer or other payer issues a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips.html">Tax slip (T-slip)</a> to you and the CRA, showing  your income, deductions, and the amounts paid to the CRA on your behalf.  </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/long-should-you-keep-your-income-tax-records.html">Keep all  receipts and documents for at least six years </a>after  you file your return.

It is sometimes called &quot;working under the table&quot; and can  include unreported or underreported income from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>tips and gratuities received in addition to your regular       income</li>
        <li>employment income not reported on a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips.html">T-slip</a></li>
        <li>business income not reported on a T-slip, including       self-employed individuals providing services without a registered business       number</li>
        <li>earning extra income on the side of your full-time work (for       example, by renting out a room or providing a ride-sharing service)</li>

        <li>the exchange of goods or services (bartering with another       individual or business) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Generally, income you earn is taxable and has to be reported on  your tax return, even if you do not receive a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4.html">T4 slip </a> and when the activity is not your main source of income.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>some require an application, while others are  automatically calculated when you do your taxes every year</li>
      <li>payments can be monthly, quarterly, or annually</li>

      <p>If any of your documents are in a language other than English or French, you’ll need to provide copies of the original documents along with an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra/common-adjustments.html#toc4">acceptable translation</a>. </p>

    <p>In most cases, the CRA automatically considers you for benefit  and credit payments when you do your taxes. However, if you applied for and are  receiving <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/child-and-family-benefits.html">benefit and credit</a> payments, you need to file a tax return on time  each year to keep receiving them without interruption.  </p>
    <p>The CRA needs your tax return each year to calculate your benefit  and credit payments, even if you do not owe tax, are tax-exempt, or have no  income to report.</p>
    <p>As residents for income tax purposes, you and your spouse or  common‑law partner, if applicable, have until April 30 to do your taxes for the  previous year. If you or your spouse or common‑law partner are self-employed,  the deadline to do your taxes is June 15.</p>
    <p>If you live in Quebec, you also need to file a provincial tax  return each year with <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a>.</p>
