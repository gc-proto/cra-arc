<li>the amount has been taken into account as tax or net tax in an assessment</li>
<li>the amount paid was tax, net tax, penalty, interest, or any other amount assessed</li>
<li>the amount is the result of an appraisal or reappraisal of the value of goods, or a determination that the GST/HST applies to the goods by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)</li>
<li>you are a GST/HST registrant and the amount paid in error resulted from an incorrectly filled-out GST/HST return which has been or will be corrected</li>

<h6><strong>Assignment of rights to the rebate</strong></h6>
<p>For the rebate for exported artistic works, instead of paying the GST/HST when you make your purchase and filing the rebate application to get the tax back, you can assign your rights to your GST/HST rebate to the GST/HST registered supplier. By doing this, the supplier pays or credits your rebate to you at the time of your purchase so that you can make your purchase without paying the GST/HST.</p>
<p>You can assign your rights to a GST/HST rebate to your Canadian supplier of the property or services if <strong>all</strong> the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are not a registrant</li>
<li>you acquire the&nbsp;property or services (except for a service of storing or shipping property), to consume or use only for making or producing an original literary, musical, artistic, motion picture, or other work with copyright protection</li>

        <p>You can use this example or design your own agreement. You have to give your supplier a copy of this assignment as documentation required to allow him or her to credit you the GST/HST payable.</p>

        <p>A person that administers a legal aid plan is trying to determine the amount eligible for a rebate under <strong>reason&nbsp;code 5</strong>. The plan has paid the GST on office expenses. A lawyer also provided legal services to the plan administrator and charged&nbsp;the plan the GST. The lawyer incurred some expenses in&nbsp;their capacity as a lawyer providing services to the plan administrator (long distance calls and photocopying court decisions).

<p>The plan administrator is eligible to claim a rebate under <strong>reason code 5</strong> for the GST/HST paid on the legal services provided by the lawyer, including the long-distance calls and photocopies that are part of the legal services provided.</p>
<p>The plan administrator is not eligible to claim a rebate under <strong>reason code 5</strong> for the office expenses and the medical report, as these are not supplies of legal services.</p>
<p>However, where the person responsible for administering the legal aid plan is a public service body, it may qualify for a public service bodies' rebate for some of the tax paid on expenses that are not legal services (such as the office expenses, the medical report and any other purchases that are not legal services) at the rate applicable to that public service body.</p>

<p>A creditor can seize a person's real property or capital personal property for non-payment of a debt and sell it to a third party to recover the debt.

<p>In this case, you cannot apply for the rebate unless the time limit for redeeming the property has expired and you have not redeemed the property.

The $20,000 includes the amount necessary for the&nbsp;city to recover Mr. Jones’ tax arrears owing to the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones can redeem the land up to two years after October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017. Mr. Jones is only eligible for a rebate of the&nbsp;GST if the redemption period has expired and he has not redeemed the property. Therefore, he can file his rebate application only at some time after October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2019. However, he has to file it before October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2021.</p>
<p>The value of the rebate will be equal to the GST calculated on the land’s fair market value on October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, or to the&nbsp;basic tax content of the property as of October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, whichever amount is less.</p>

<p>As you are not a registrant, you will generally calculate the basic tax content of your property by</p>
<ol>
<li>totalling the amount of GST/HST that you paid to acquire the property and make any improvements to it</li>
<li>deducting any amounts that you were entitled to recover by rebate, refund, remission or otherwise, or would have been entitled to recover had the property been acquired for use only in non-commercial activities</li>
<li>taking depreciation in the value of the property into account by multiplying the difference (as calculated above) by a depreciation factor</li>
</ol>
<p>For municipalities that are not listed financial institutions, the <strong>basic tax content</strong> calculation at any time after <span class="nowrap"><strong>January 30, 2004</strong></span>, is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>(A - B) × C</strong></p>
<p>where:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A </strong>is the GST/HST you paid for the last acquisition or importation of the property and for any improvements</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> is the amount of any GST/HST you were entitled to recover by rebate (like the one for <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#public">public service bodies</a>), refund, remission or otherwise</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> is the <strong>lesser </strong>of:</p>
<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>the fair market value of the property at the time the property was sold, <strong>divided by</strong> the amount paid (before tax)&nbsp;on your last acquisition of&nbsp;the property and improvements made to it</li>
</ul>
<p>The amounts for<strong> A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> do not include the GST and the federal part of the HST paid or payable before <span class="nowrap"><strong>February 2004</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For more information on these and other changes for municipalities, see&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4049.html">Guide RC4049, GST/HST Information for Municipalities</a>.</p>

        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h5 class="wb-inv">Using your rebate to reduce your remittance of the GST/HST</h5>
<p>Generally, when you sell taxable real property or capital personal property, you have to collect the GST/HST from the purchaser and remit the GST/HST to us. However, there are some exceptions for taxable sales of real property.</p>
<p>You do not have to collect the GST/HST on a taxable sale of real property; rather, the purchaser has to remit the tax on their purchase to us directly, if:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the purchaser is registered for the GST/HST (if, however, the purchaser is a registered individual buying a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#complex">residential complex</a> or cemetery plot, you have to collect the tax)</li>
<li>you are a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#nonresident">non-resident</a></li>
<li>you and the purchaser have made an election type 2 on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst22.html">Form GST22, Real Property –&nbsp;Election to Make Certain Sales Taxable</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the special rules for remitting tax on a taxable sale of real property, including who has to remit the tax and how they do so, call&nbsp;<strong>1-800-959-8287</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are responsible for collecting the tax from the purchaser, report that tax and remit it&nbsp;using Form GST62, Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) (Non-Personalized) Return.</p>
<p>Generally, the amount of your remittance will be the amount you indicate as net tax on <strong>line 109 </strong>of Form GST62. However, if you are entitled to a rebate under reason code 7, you can simply remit the difference between the net tax amount on <strong>line 109 </strong>of Form GST62 and the amount of your rebate. To do this, enter the amount of your rebate on<strong> line 111 </strong>of Form GST62. If you do this, the amount you will have to remit is equal to the amount on <strong>line 109 </strong>less the amount on <strong>line 111</strong>.</p>
<p>File your rebate application together with Form GST62 if you want to reduce your remittance by the amount of your rebate.</p>
<p>File Form GST62 within <strong>one month </strong>after the month in which the transaction happens. The CRA will assess penalty and interest if Form GST62 and any net tax remittance is not received by the due date.</p>
<p>Form GST62 is only available in pre-printed format. To order Form GST62, go to <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/cjcf/fpos-scfp/pub/rdr?request_locale=en_CA">Order forms and publications</a><span class="nowrap">.</span></p>

<h4 id="Eligibility16"><strong></strong>Find out if you are eligible for the rebate</h4>
<p>Use <strong>reason code 16</strong> for qualifying items purchased and consumed in the same province where the point-of-sale rebate was not granted.

<p>Generally, if you buy a qualifying item in a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#province">participating province</a> that provides a provincial point-of-sale rebate for the designated item, the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#registrant">registrant</a>&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#supplier">supplier</a> will credit you with the rebate of the provincial part of the HST due at the time of your purchase. This means that you usually will not pay the provincial part of the HST when you buy a designated item in a participating province that provides a provincial point-of-sale rebate for the designated item.</p>
<p>The point-of-sale rebate applies to sales of qualifying items at retail establishments, over the internet, and at any point in the distribution chain. However, if the registrant supplier does not credit the rebate to you, you can apply for a rebate of the provincial part of the HST paid on the sale of qualifying items under reason code 16.</p>
<p>You can apply for this rebate if <strong>either</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>You bought a qualifying item in a participating province that provides a provincial point-of-sale rebate for the qualifying item you paid the provincial part of the HST, and the registrant supplier did not credit you with the rebate of the provincial part of the HST due at the time of your purchase</li>
<li>You brought a qualifying item into a participating province that provides a provincial point-of-sale rebate in for the qualifying item and you have self-assessed and remitted the provincial part of the HST at the applicable rate for the participating province</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a registrant, you may also&nbsp;be eligible to claim an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#itc">input tax credit</a>&nbsp;(ITC) to recover the 5% federal part of the HST paid. You cannot claim an ITC to recover the provincial part of the HST paid. Instead,&nbsp;apply for a rebate under <strong>reason code 16</strong>.</p>

        <h4 id="Claim23">How to report and&nbsp;claim&nbsp;the rebate</h4>
<h5>How GST/HST registrant suppliers report credited amounts</h5>
<p>In contrast to <a href="#Eligibility16">point-of-sale rebates</a> for certain qualifying items (such as children's items and books), the supplier will need to include&nbsp;on its GST/HST return <strong>all</strong> of&nbsp;the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of HST collected or collectible for the supplies on <strong>line 103 </strong>at the full 13% rate (if you are filing your GST/HST return online, include this amount on <strong>line 105</strong>)</li>
<li>the amounts credited at the point of sale on <strong>line 111</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the GST/HST registrant would be required to fill out&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst189.html">Form GST189, General Application for GST/HST Rebates</a>, using reason code 23. On the form, the registrant would be required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>report the amount that has been credited to status Indian purchasers at the point of sale</li>
<li>indicate in the appropriate box that this amount has been set off on <strong>line 111 </strong>of the GST/HST return against the remittance amount on the GST/HST return</li>
<li>identify the reporting period to which the set-off on the GST/HST return applies</li>
</ul>
<p>Do <strong>not </strong>include amounts for items that are otherwise relieved from GST/HST or eligible for a point-of-sale rebate of the provincial part of the HST for certain qualifying items.</p>
<h5>How GST/HST registrant suppliers show the amount credited on their invoices</h5>
<p>When disclosing the HST on an invoice or receipt issued for a qualifying off-reserve supply of property or services for which the GST/HST registrant supplier has credited an amount to a status Indian purchaser at the point of sale, the registrant supplier may show <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the total amount of the HST payable (or the total HST rate) with the rebate amount paid or credited shown separately</li>
<li>the total HST payable as an amount net of the rebate amount credited</li>
<li>the total price of the qualifying property or service that includes HST at a net rate of 5%</li>
</ul>
<p>The netting of the HST amount to 5%, or having the price include HST at a net rate of 5%, is only permitted on the invoice, while the GST/HST return must show tax at <strong>13%</strong> on <strong>line 105</strong>, Total GST/HST and adjustments, and the amount credited on <strong>line 111</strong>, Rebates.</p>
<p>Unlike other cases where the 8% provincial part of the HST is credited by GST/HST registrants (such as the point-of-sale rebates for certain qualifying items), the amount credited for qualifying off-reserve purchases made by status Indian purchasers is not a deduction in the calculation of the registrant's net tax.<span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-CA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"></span></p>

        <h3 class="wb-inv">Reason code 25 – Rebate for certain investment plans and segregated funds of an insurer (subsection 261.31(2))</h3>
<h4>Find out if you are eligible for the rebate</h4>
<p>You may be eligible for a rebate under <strong>reason code 25</strong> for all or a portion of the provincial part of the HST in respect of tax that became payable, or was paid without becoming payable, if you are <strong>one </strong>of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>an investment plan or a segregated fund of an insurer that is not a selected listed financial institution (SLFI), such as a trust governed by an RRSP that is not an SLFI</li>
<li>a provincial stratified investment plan that is an SLFI</li>
</ul>
<p>Each rebate amount for which an application is made under&nbsp;subsection 261.31(2) for the purposes of <strong>reason code 25 </strong>must be at least <strong>$25 Canadian</strong>.</p>
<p>Under proposed changes to regulations related to the Excise Tax Act (ETA), an investment plan is a &quot;provincial investment plan&quot; for a particular province at any time where the investment plan meets <strong>any</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>is at that time a financial institution described in section 11 of the Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations, the units of which are permitted, under the laws of Canada or a province, to be sold only in the particular province</li>
<li>is at that time a stratified investment plan, all the series of which are provincial series for the particular province</li>
<li>meets <strong>both</strong> of the following criteria:<ul>
<li>the investment plan has, throughout the taxation year in which the fiscal year of the investment plan that includes that time ends, a permanent establishment in the particular province, as determined in accordance with section 3 of theSelected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations</li>
<li>the investment plan does not have, throughout that taxation year, a permanent establishment in a province other than the particular province, as determined in accordance with section 3 of the Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the proposed changes, a provincial stratified investment plan means a stratified investment plan (other than a provincial investment plan) with one or more provincial series.</p>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> use reason code 25 if you are an insurer that elects with your segregated fund to pay or credit the relevant part of the rebate directly to your segregated fund. Instead, use reason code 26.</p>

        <h5 class="wb-inv">How to calculate the rebate amount under section 261.31</h5>
<p>If you are an investment plan that meets the eligibility criteria referred to above, apply the formulas below to calculate the rebate amount applicable to you under proposed subsection 261.31(2) with respect to tax on taxable supplies made in a participating province under subsection 165(2), section 212.1, or section 218.1 or amounts self-assessed under Division IV.1 of the ETA.</p>

<p>This rebate is for provincial stratified investment plans</p>
<p><strong>Rebate amount on the provincial part of the HST under <span class="nowrap">subsection 165(2)</span> of the ETA</strong></p>
<p>If you are a provincial stratified investment plan and tax is payable for a participating province under subsection 165(2) for a supply of property or a service, use the following formula to determine the amount of the rebate you can claim on these tax amounts for each provincial series:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A - B) × C&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> is the amount of the <strong>provincial part </strong>of the HST</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> is the amount of tax that would have become payable under subsection 165(2) for the supply at that time if that tax were calculated at the provincial tax rate for the participating province, if the provincial&nbsp;series is for a participating province. Otherwise, B is zero</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> is the extent (expressed as a percentage) to which the property or service was acquired for consumption, use or supply in the course of the activities relating to the provincial series, as determined in accordance with section 51 of the Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations</p>
<p><strong>Rebate amount on tax with respect to tangible personal property</strong></p>
<p>If you are a provincial stratified investment plan&nbsp;and tax is payable under section 212.1 or 218.1 or subsection 220.06(1) for tangible personal property, use the following formula to determine the rebate you can claim for a provincial series:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D - E) × F</strong></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> is the amount of the <strong>provincial part </strong>of the HST self-assessed under the applicable section or subsection referred to above</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> is the amount of tax that would have become payable under the applicable section or subsection for the property at the particular time if that tax were calculated at the tax rate for that participating province and if the provincial series is for a participating province. Otherwise, E is zero</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> is the extent (expressed as a percentage) to which the tangible personal property was acquired, or imported for consumption, use or supply in the course of the activities relating to the provincial series, as determined in accordance with section 51 of the Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations</p>
<p><strong>Rebate amount on tax payable under <span class="nowrap">subsection 220.05(1)</span> or 220.07(1) of the ETA</strong></p>
<p>If you are a provincial stratified investment plan and tax is payable under subsection 220.05(1) or subsection 220.07(1), use the following formula to determine the amount of the rebate you can claim for tangible personal property brought into a particular participating province for a provincial series:</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl"><strong>(G - H) × I</strong></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> is the amount of the <strong>provincial part </strong>of the HST self-assessed under the applicable section referred to above</p>

<ul>
<li>if the provincial series is for the particular participating province, the amount of that tax</li>

        <h3 class="wb-inv">Reason code 26 – Election between the segregated fund and insurer (subsection 261.31(3))</h3>
<h4>Find out if you are eligible for the rebate</h4>
<p>Subsection 261.31(3) allows a segregated fund of an insurer to file an election to obtain rebates directly from the insurer for services supplied to the segregated fund by the insurer. Where the insurer pays or credits a rebate to the segregated fund under these provisions, it may, under subsection 234(5), claim a deduction equal to the rebate in determining its net tax. The insurer must send the rebate application with the return in which the deduction is claimed.</p>
<p>You must fill out Part G if you are an insurer and want to pay or credit an investment plan or segregated fund directly. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4033.html">Guide RC4033, General Application for GST/HST Rebates</a>.</p>
<p>The rebate amount under the election between the insurer and the segregated fund of the insurer under subsection 261.31(3) (reason code 26) must be at least <strong>$25 Canadian</strong>.</p>
<p>If the insurer <strong>does not </strong>pay or credit the rebate to you and you meet all the eligibility criteria, you can file for your rebate under <strong>reason code 25</strong>.</p>
<h5>Joint and several liability</h5>
<p>If an insurer pays or credits a rebate to its segregated fund, deducts the amount in determining its net tax, and the insurer knows or ought to know that the segregated fund is not entitled to all or part of the rebate, both the insurer and its segregated fund who received the rebate are liable to pay the amount to us.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="Calculate26">Calculating the rebate</h4>
<p>Fill out Part A, B, E, F, and Section&nbsp;1 of Part C of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst189.html">Form GST189, General Application for GST/HST Rebates</a>. Indicate what you would have received if the insurer had not paid or credited the amount to you.</p>
<p>The amount of the rebate is determined by using the application formula from reason code 25.</p>
<p>The insurer has to fill out Part G – Registered supplier identification or insurer election and send the rebate application with the GST/HST return for the period in which the insurer paid or credited the rebate. The insurer claims the amount of the rebate on line 107 of the return.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="Duedate26">When to file&nbsp;the rebate application</h4>
