           <!--  <h3>Late-filed rebate applications for owner built homes</h3>
             <p>If, due to extraordinary circumstances, you were prevented from filing your rebate application for an owner built home by the applicable deadline, we will consider a request to accept your late-filed rebate application. </p>

             <ul>
               <li>Natural or human made disasters, such as a flood or fire</li>
               <li>Civil disturbances or disruptions in services, such as a postal strike</li>

   <p>Major changes have to be made to meet the definition of a substantial renovation. In a major renovation project, the interior of a building is essentially gutted. Generally, 90% or more of the interior of the existing housing has to be removed or replaced to qualify as a substantial renovation (the 90% test).
</p>   
<p>You do not have to remove or replace the foundation, exterior and interior supporting walls, roof, floors, and staircases to meet the 90% test.</p>
<p>Only livable areas count towards a substantial renovation, including finished basements and finished attics. Livable areas do not include garages or crawl spaces. Work done to partially complete a basement but not make it a livable basement does not count toward the 90% test.
