           <ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">
      <li>
    <h3>You must be a first-time home buyer</h3>
    <p>Generally, to be considered a first-time home buyer, <strong>all</strong> of the following must be true:
      <ul class="fa-ul">
       <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>You are at least 18 years of age</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>You are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>You have <strong>not</strong> lived in a home that you or your spouse or common-law partner owned, or jointly owned, whether in or outside of Canada, as your <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="sign-in-partners" href="#primary-place-of-residence">primary place of residence<span class="mrgn-lft-xs far fa-question-circle"></span></a> at any time in the <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="sign-in-partners" href="#calendar-year">calendar year<span class="mrgn-lft-xs far fa-question-circle"></span></a> or in the previous 4 calendar years
        <details>
          <summary>Examples of calendar year or in the previous 4 calendar years</summary>
          <p>If you take ownership of a new home from a builder in 2025, you must not have lived in a home as your primary place of residence that was owned by you or your spouse or common-law partner in the 2025 calendar year, or in 2024, 2023, 2022, or 2021 (the previous 4 calendar years).</p>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>    
<p>An individual previously lived in a home that they owned. They sold it in June 2021. Since then, the individual has lived in a rental apartment.</p>
<p>The individual entered into an agreement to purchase a new home from a builder on or after March 20, 2025 and they took ownership of the home in August 2025.</p>
<p>The individual is <strong>not</strong> considered a first-time home buyer, as they lived in a home that they owned in 2021, which is in the previous 4 calendar years from the year when they took ownership of the new home.
</p>
          <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>An individual previously lived in a home that they owned. They sold it in June 2021. Since then, the individual has lived in a rental apartment.</p>
<p>The individual entered into an agreement to purchase a new home from a builder on or after March 20, 2025 and they took ownership of the home in February 2026.</p>
<p>If all other conditions for the rebate are met, the individual would be considered a first-time home buyer, as they did not live in a home that they or their spouse or common-law partner owned in the calendar year or previous 4 calendar years.</p>

   <p>Major changes have to be made to meet the definition of a substantial renovation. In a major renovation project, the interior of a building is essentially gutted. Generally, 90% or more of the interior of the existing housing has to be removed or replaced to qualify as a substantial renovation (the 90% test).
</p>   
<p>You do not have to remove or replace the foundation, exterior and interior supporting walls, roof, floors, and staircases to meet the 90% test.</p>
<p>Only livable areas count towards a substantial renovation, including finished basements and finished attics. Livable areas do not include garages or crawl spaces. Work done to partially complete a basement but not make it a livable basement does not count toward the 90% test.
