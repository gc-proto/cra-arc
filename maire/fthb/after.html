            <h2 id="h-1">When your application will be processed</h2>
            <p>In most cases, the CRA will be able to process rebate applications within standard processing times. A small number of applications may experience processing delays, due to a legislative amendment that changed the starting date for this rebate from May 27, 2025, to March 20, 2025, and the introduction of the Ontario FTHB rebate.</p>
           <p>As a result of these changes, certain applications will be affected. These include:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Applications where the purchaser entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with a builder or started construction on their owner-built home between the dates of March 20, 2025 and May 26, 2025 </li>
           <li>Applications for the Ontario FTHB rebate</li>
           </ul>
            <p>The CRA expects to begin processing these applications by spring 2026.</p>
            <h2 id="h-2">What records to keep</h2>
            <p>Keep the following records for 6 years:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>A copy of the completed rebate application(s), including the Ontario rebate schedule (if applicable) and calculation worksheet(s)</li>
             <li>All of the documents used to fill out the application forms, including original invoices for <span class="nowrap">owner-built</span> homes and the purchase and sale agreement for homes purchased from a builder</li>
              <li>Proof of occupancy</li>
           </ul>
           
            <h2 id="h-3">Notice of assessment</h2>
            <p>A notice of assessment will be issued after your rebate application has been processed. The notice of assessment explains the assessment of your rebate application and any changes that were made.</p>
            <h2 id="h-4">When you will receive your payment</h2>
            <p>Because all claims are subject to audit, you may experience a delay of up to 6 months before receiving your payment. </p>
           <p>The processing of your claim may be delayed or your rebate denied if any of the following are true:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Forms are not completed in full</li>
             <li>Rebate calculation is incorrect</li>
             <li>Required documents are not submitted with your application</li>
           </ul>
              <h2 id="h-5">Change a processed application</h2>
            <p>You may disagree with an assessment or want to change a processed rebate application. To determine your options for resolving the issue, including possibly filing an objection, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc459.html">use the GST/HST objection decision tool</a>.</p>
             <p>Learn more about filing an objection: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/file-objection-cppei-appeal-minister/gst-hst.html">File an objection – GST/HST</a></p>
           <h2 id="h-6">Reprisal complaint</h2>
            <p>If you have previously submitted a service complaint or requested a formal review of a CRA decision and feel you were not treated impartially by a CRA employee, you can submit a reprisal complaint by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc459.html">Form RC459, Reprisal Complaint</a>.</p>
