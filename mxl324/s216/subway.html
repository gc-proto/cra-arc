        <p>Canadian payers (such as the tenant) or agents (such as the property manager) must withhold non-resident tax
            on the rental income they pay or credit to a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> of Canada. If you
            are a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span>, the tax withheld is usually your final tax obligation to
            Canada on the rental income.</p>
        <p>You can choose, however, to file a Canadian return to report your rental income from real or immovable
            property income by electing under <span class="nowrap">section 216</span> of the Income Tax
            Act. By making this election, you pay tax on your <strong>net </strong><span
                class="nowrap">Canadian-source</span> rental income instead of the <strong>gross</strong> amount
            and may receive a refund for all or part of the <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> tax
            withheld</p>
