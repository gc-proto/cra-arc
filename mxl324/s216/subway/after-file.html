                <p>For more information, go to&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra.html">Payments to the Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</p>

                <p>If you want to mail your payment to the&nbsp;CRA, attach it to the front of your return. Make sure that you make out the payment 
                    to the Receiver General. Write your social insurance number, individual tax number, or temporary tax number and “Section 216” on the payment to help the CRA process it correctly.</p>

                <p>Your payment will be considered paid on one of the following dates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payments you or your representative make through a Canadian financial&nbsp;institution's online&nbsp;or telephone banking services are considered paid when your financial institution credits the CRA with your payment</li>
                    <li>Payments you or your representative make in person at a Canadian financial institution are considered paid on the date stamped on your remittance voucher</li>
                    <li>Post-dated&nbsp;payments you or your representative make by&nbsp;pre-authorized&nbsp;debit are considered paid on the negotiable date</li>
                    <li>Payments you or your representative send by mail are considered paid on the day of the postmark</li>
                </ul>
               <p><strong>Exeption</strong>: When a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public&nbsp;holiday recognized by the CRA, your payment is considered on time if the CRA receives it or if it is postmarked on the next <span class="nowrap">business day</span>. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals.html">Due dates and payment dates</a>.</p>

                <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>You can file your return early and make a <span class="nowrap">post-dated</span> payment. If the CRA processes your return before the date of the payment, your payment will appear on your notice of assessment but it will not reduce your balance owing. The CRA will credit your account on the date of the payment.</p>
        <p>The CRA will charge you a fee for any payment that your&nbsp;financial institution does not honour.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Making a payment arrangement</strong></h3>
            <p>If you cannot pay your balance owing <strong>on or before <span class="nowrap">April&nbsp;30</span>,&nbsp;2025</strong>, the 
                CRA may accept a payment arrangement only after you have made a reasonable effort to get the necessary funds by borrowing or 
                rearranging your finances. If you cannot pay the balance in full, <a href="#P285_30547">contact the CRA</a> to discuss a mutually 
                acceptable payment arrangement based on your ability to pay. The CRA will still charge daily compound interest on any outstanding balance.</p>

    <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
    <h2>Notice of assessment</h2>
             <p>When the CRA receives your return, it is usually reviewed based on the information you provided and a notice of 
                 assessment is sent to you. However, the CRA may select your return for a more detailed review <strong>before 
                 </strong>the CRA assesses it. If so, your assessment may be delayed while the CRA asks you to send documents to support 
                 the deductions and credits you claimed.</p>
            <p>The CRA may also carry out a more detailed review <strong>after </strong>your return has been assessed to verify 
                the income reported and the deductions or credits claimed.</p>
        
    <h2>How to change a return</h2>
        <p>Do <strong>not </strong>send the CRA another <span class="nowrap">Section 216</span> return for the year that you 
            want to change. Instead, send the following documents to your tax centre:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a completed <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T1-ADJ,
                    </span> T1 Adjustment Request</a>, or a signed letter providing the details of your request, including the following:
                        <ul>
                        <li>the year of the return to be changed</li>
                        <li>your <span class="nowrap">social insurance number (SIN)</span>, <span class="nowrap">individual tax number (ITN)</span>, or <span class="nowrap">temporary tax number (TTN)</span></li>
                        <li>your address</li>
                        <li>your telephone number where the CRA can reach you during the day</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>supporting documents for the changes you are requesting and, if you have not sent them to the CRA before, supporting documents for your original claim</li>
                </ul>
        <p>It usually takes eight weeks for the CRA to complete the adjustment and mail you a notice of reassessment.</p>

        <h2>Update your personal information</h2>
            <p>If you move, let the CRA know your new address <strong>as soon as possible</strong>. Keeping the CRA informed 
                will ensure that the CRA mails your <span class="nowrap">section 216 </span>tax package to the correct address next year.</p>
            <p>If you registered with the My Account service, you can change your address by going to 
                <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account for Individuals</a>. 
                If not, you must tell the CRA your new address by phone or in writing.</p>
            <p>If you are writing to the CRA, send your letter to the applicable tax centre shown in the section called <a href="#P285_30547">Contact the Canada Revenue Agency</a>. 
                Include your <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr>, <abbr title="individual tax number">ITN</abbr>, or <abbr title="temporary tax number">TTN</abbr>, 
                your new address, the date of your move, and your signature.</p>
            <p>If you are writing on behalf of someone else such as your spouse or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner, include their
                <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr>, <abbr title="individual tax number">ITN</abbr>, or <abbr title="temporary tax number">TTN</abbr> 
                and if you are not already registered as an authorized representative, have them sign the letter authorizing you to change their records.</p>
