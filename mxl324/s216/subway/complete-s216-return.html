                                    <p>If you want to mail your payment to the CRA, attach it to the front
                                        of your return. Make sure that you make out the payment to the Receiver
                                        General. Write your social insurance number, individual tax number, or
                                        temporary tax number and “Section 216” on the payment to help the CRA
                                        process it correctly.</p>
                                    <p>Your payment will be considered paid on one of the following dates:</p>

                                        may accept a payment arrangement only after you have made a reasonable
                                        effort to get the necessary funds by borrowing or rearranging your
                                        finances. If you cannot pay the balance in full, <a href="#P285_30547">contact the CRA</a> to
                                        discuss a mutually
                                        acceptable payment arrangement based on your ability to pay. The CRA
                                        will still charge daily compound interest on any outstanding balance.
