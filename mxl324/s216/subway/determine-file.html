                    <p>As a non-resident of Canada, you can choose to send a separate return to pay less taxes. Choosing to send the CRA this return is called electing under section 216 of the Income Tax Act.</p>
                    
                
                <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
        
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#h-1">Choosing not to elect</a></li>

                <h2 id="h-1">Choosing not to elect</h2>            
                <p>If you do not elect under Section 216, the withholding tax of 25% on your gross rental income is considered your <strong>final tax obligation</strong>. You don’t have to file a return. </p>

                <h2 id="h-2">Filing a section 216 return after the end of the year</h2>
                    <p>Electing under section 216 allows you to recalculate tax on your <strong>net</strong> Canadian-source rental income instead of the <strong>gross</strong> amount and get the difference refunded to you</p>
		    <p>Filing a section 216 return is beneficial if the 25% non-resident tax withheld during the year is more than the amount of tax payable on your Section 216 return.</p>
                    <p>To make this choice, complete <a herf="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1159.html">Form T1159, Income Tax Return for Electing under Section 216</a> and mail it within two years after the end of the rental income year.</p>
                    <p>For more details, go to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/mxl324/s216/subway/complete-s216-return.html">How to complete your return</a>.</p>
                    
                <h2 id="h-3">Sending Form NR6 on or before January 1</h2>
                    <p>You can elect to have tax withheld during the year on your <strong>net</strong> rental income instead of the <strong>gross</strong> amount. 
			    If the CRA approves your Form NR6, you <strong>must</strong> file a Section 216 return <strong>on or before June 30, 2025</strong>.</p>
                    <p>To make this choice, you (or each non-resident who is a member of a partnership) <strong>and</strong> your agent have to complete <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr6.html">Form NR6, Undertaking to File an Income Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent from Real or Immovable Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty</a>, and send it to the CRA for approval <strong>on or before January 1 of each year</strong> or before the first rental payment is due. </p>
			<p>Your agent must continue to withhold non-resident tax on the gross rental income until the CRA approves your Form NR6 in writing.</p>
                    
		    <h3>If the CRA approved your Form NR6</h3>
                    <p>If you sent the CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr6.html">Form NR6</a> for 2024 and the CRA approved it, you <strong>must file</strong> your 2024 Section 216 return <strong>on or before June 30, 2025</strong>.</p>
		    <p>You must include the income and expenses from <strong>all</strong> of your Canadian rental properties in <strong>one</strong> Section 216 return. You have to file a return even if you have no tax payable or are not expecting a refund.</p>
                    <p>If you do not fulfill your obligation, you will have to pay to the full amount of non-resident tax, as well as applicable interest charges. 
                        We calculate the required amount of tax at the statutory rate of 25% of the gross rental income, minus the amount of tax already remitted for the year. </p>

                        <summary>What your agent will do after the CRA approves Form NR6</summary>
			<p>Your agent must continue to withhold non-resident tax on the gross rental income until the CRA approves your Form NR6 <strong>in writing</strong>.</p>
                        <p>After the CRA approves your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr6.html">Form NR6</a>, your agent can withhold non-resident tax of 25% on your net rental income (that is the amount of rental income available after the rental expenses have been paid). Your agent must pay the tax on or before the 15th day of the month after the month the rental income is paid or credited to you. You should discuss this with your agent to make sure they withhold and remit the correct amount of non-resident tax to the CRA on your behalf.</p>
                        <p>If your agent does not withhold and remit this non-resident tax, the CRA will charge compound daily interest on the amount not withheld and remitted. The CRA may also charge a penalty.</p>
                        <p>The agent has to give you two copies of an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr4.html">NR4 slip</a> showing the gross amount of rental income paid or credited to you during the year and the amount of non-resident tax withheld. The agent also has to send the CRA a completed NR4 information return as explained in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4061.html">Guide T4061, NR4 – Non-Resident Tax Withholding, Remitting, and Reporting</a>.</p>

		    <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">To get help with Form NR6 or enquire about the processing status, contact the <a href="#nrws">Non-Resident Withholding Section</a></p>
		    
                    <h3>If your Form NR6 was not approved </h3>
		    <p>Your agent must continue to withhold non-resident tax on the gross rental income until the end of the year. You may choose to <a href="#h-2">file a section 216 return after the end of the year</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="h-4">If you sold your rental property</h2>
                    <p>You must file a section 216 return <strong>if both</strong> of the following conditions apply:<p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You previously <strong>claimed Capital Cost Allowance (CCA)</strong> under Section 216 for this property.</li>
                            <li>You are including a <strong>recapture of CCA</strong> on your return.</li>
                        </ul>

		    	<p>To determine if you have a recapture of CCA, you may use <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t776.html">Form T776</a> to calculate the recapture of CCA. For instructions, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/rental-income/completing-form-t776-statement-real-estate-rentals/line-9947-recaptured-capital-cost-allowance.html">Recaptured capital cost allowance</a>.</p>
	                <p>If you must file, send your Section 216 return and pay any balance owing by <strong>April 30</strong> of the year following the sale, whether you completed Form NR6 or not.</p>
			<p>If you have rental income from more than one rental property in Canada, you must report <strong>all</strong> of your Canadian rental income and expenses together in <strong>one</strong> Section 216 return.</p>
