    <h3 class="h4 mrgn-tp-0">References to trust accounts examinations</h3>
<p>The term trust accounts examinations is used because these involve funds held in trust for the government, such as <strong>payroll deductions</strong> withheld from employees and <strong>GST/HST collected</strong> from customers. </p>
   
 </div> </div>
<p>Generally, trust accounts examinations are done to make sure that the information you provided on your information returns is correct, complete and you have met all your withholding and reporting obligations. </p>
<p>The focus of an examination is different from a tax audit because it is only related to your <strong>payroll and GST/HST reporting obligations</strong>. </p>
 
<details>
      <summary>Why are examinations important</summary>
<p>Trust accounts examinations promote employer awareness and understanding of tax laws and their obligations under the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Employment Insurance Act, and their respective regulations, to increase and enhance voluntary compliance. </p>
  <p>The purpose of trust accounts examinations is to maintain the integrity of the tax system with respect to <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The <strong>reporting</strong> of employment income and taxable benefits</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The <strong>withholding and remitting</strong> of payroll related amounts (your employee's CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions, and your share of the CPP contributions and EI premiums) </li>
       <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The GST/HST <strong>collecting, remitting and filing</strong> requirements</li>    
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The proper <strong>characterization of workers</strong> (employee or self-employed)</li>
    </ul>	
  <p>Compliance with these obligations is achieved through a combination of taxpayer education and responsible enforcement. </p>	
</details>
   
    
<h2>How the process works</h2>
 <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm"></span><strong>Timeline:</strong> Generally, the <strong>full</strong> process is completed within 60 days</p>

   <details>
      <summary>Using an <strong>authorized representative</strong></summary>
      <p>Even if a professional tax preparer completed your payroll and GST/HST returns (for example, T4 slips and T4 summary) on your behalf, you are responsible for making sure your business meets all their payroll and GST/HST tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your remittance amounts and information returns, but they may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA may contact you directly for the review.</p>

     <p>If the CRA sends a letter to the authorized representative asking for information about one of their clients, the authorized representative <strong>must</strong> respond by the date mentioned in the letter.</p>
      <h4>If you choose to authorize a representative</h4>
      <p>You can use different methods to authorize a representative.</p>

    <h4><span class="fas fa-user-shield fa-xl mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Confirm the visit is from the CRA authorized officer</h4>

<li>Request that they show their CRA authorization card (RC121A) to prove that they are a representative of the CRA (this card includes their <strong>name, photo and badge number</strong>)  </li>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">If you <strong>doubt the legitimacy of a visit</strong> from a CRA officer, contact the CRA from the  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html#bsn-02">CRA's list of phone numbers</a> and ask an agent to confirm the officer's identity.</p>

<h4> <span class="far fa-calendar-alt mrgn-rght-sm"></span> When to provide the required documents</h4>

<p>The following is a list of the most common changes to your T4 or T4A returns the CRA officer can make once they finished reviewing your books and records:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="h4">Amend or add T4 slips</h3>
<p>The CRA officer may amend your T4 slips to correct the reporting by increasing or reducing the amount reported on the slip.</p>
<p>They may also add T4 slips where a slip was not originally filed or when the employment status has been determined to be different from how it was reported on the original slip.</p>
<p>Changes are most commonly made to the following boxes or codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total employment income (<strong>box 14</strong>)</li>
<li>Income tax deducted (<strong>box 22</strong>)</li>
<li>CPP contributions (<strong>box 16</strong>)</li>
<li>EI premiums (<strong>box 18</strong>)</li>
<li>Insurable and pensionable earnings (<strong>box 24 and box 26</strong>)</li>
<li>Taxable benefits (<strong>codes 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 40 or 90 </strong>)</li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="h4">Amend or add T4A slips</h3>
<p>The CRA officer may amend your T4A slips to correct the reporting by increasing or reducing the amount reported on the slip.</p>
<p>They may also add T4A slips where a slip was not originally filed or when the employment status has been determined to be different from how it was reported on the original slip.</p>
<p>Changes are most commonly made to the following boxes or codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-employed commissions (<strong>box 020</strong>)</li>
<li>Income tax deducted (<strong>box 022</strong>)</li>
<li>Other income (<strong>code 028</strong>)</li>

<div id="ajax-step4b">  
<p>If the results of the examination are provided <strong>by phone</strong>, you will receive a <strong>letter</strong> to inform you the CRA officer has completed the examination. You will also receive one or both of the following <strong>statements of account</strong> that provide the results of the examination:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> <strong>PD83-1</strong>, Payroll examination - Statement of Account  (if applicable) </li>
   <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> <strong>GST501</strong>, GST/HST examination - Statement of account (if applicable) </li>
   </ul>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">The CRA officer will provide these statements of account to the <strong>legal entity</strong> and not to the authorized representative. Copies will <strong>only</strong> be provided to the authorized representative if you specifically request it.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">If you <strong>failed to report income or taxable benefits</strong> properly, you will also receive a copy of the following documents with the letter: </p>
<ul class="fa-ul">	 
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Additional or amended <strong>T4 or T4A</strong> slips (you must send copies 2 and 3 of all slips to the workers concerned, and keep copy 1 for your records)</li> 
	 </ul>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">If you <strong>failed to deduct CPP contributions and EI premiums</strong> properly, you will also receive a copy of the following documents with the letter:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">	 
 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> <strong>PD86</strong>, Discrepancies report </li>	 
    <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Additional or amended <strong>T4</strong> slips (you must send copies 2 and 3 of all slips to the workers concerned, and keep copy 1 for your records)</li> 
	 </ul>

 <h4><span class="far fa-calendar-alt mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Paying a total amount owing</h4>
    <p>As the trust account examination reviewed payroll deductions and GST/HST collected that you did not remit by their due date, the total amount owing on the statement is past due and <strong>payable immediately</strong>.</p>
 
 <p>You are required to provide the payment in full for the balance owing to the CRA officer once you receive your statements of account.</p>

<p>If you are not able to pay the total amount owing, you may set up a payment arrangement with the CRA.</p>

</li>
<li><div id="ajax-step4d"> 	
<p>If an assessment is required, you will receive a <strong>notice of assessment (<abbr title="Notice of assessment">NOA</abbr>)</strong> separately with the balance owing. The notice will provide a summary of the breakdown of that balance, including any previous arrears balance, and any penalties or interest applied to overdue payments.</p>
