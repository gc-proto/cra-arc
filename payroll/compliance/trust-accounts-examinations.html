    <h3 class="h4 mrgn-tp-0">References to trust accounts examinations</h3>
<p>The term trust accounts examinations is used because these involve funds held in trust for the government, such as <strong>payroll deductions</strong> withheld from employees and <strong>GST/HST collected</strong> from customers. </p>
    </div>
 </div>
<p>Generally, trust accounts examinations are done to make sure that the information you provided on your information returns is correct, complete and you meet all your withholding and reporting obligations. </p>
<p>The focus of an examination is different from a tax audit because it is only related to your <strong>payroll and GST/HST reporting obligations</strong>. </p>
 
<details>
      <summary>Why are examinations important</summary>
<p>Trust accounts examinations promote employer awareness and understanding of tax laws and their obligations under the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Employment Insurance Act, and their respective regulations, to increase and enhance voluntary compliance. </p>
  <p>The purpose of trust accounts examinations is to maintain the integrity of the tax system with respect to <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The <strong>reporting</strong> of employment income and taxable benefits</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The <strong>withholding and remitting</strong> of payroll related amounts (CPP contributions, EI premiums, income tax deductions) </li>
       <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The GST/HST <strong>collecting, remitting and filing</strong> requirements</li>    
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span>The proper <strong>characterization of workers</strong> (employee or self-employed)</li>
    </ul>	
  <p>Compliance with these obligations is achieved through a combination of taxpayer education and responsible enforcement. </p>

      <summary>About <strong>authorized representative</strong></summary>
      <p>Even if a professional tax preparer completed your payroll and GST/HST returns (for example, T4 slips and T4 summary) on your behalf, you are responsible for making sure your business meets all their payroll and GST/HST tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your remittance amounts and information returns, but they may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA may contact you directly for the examination.</p>

     <p>If the CRA sends a letter to the authorized representative asking for information about one of their clients, the authorized representative <strong>must</strong> respond by the date mentioned in the letter.</p>
      <h4>You want to authorize a representative</h4>
      <p>You can use different methods to authorize a representative.</p>

		<p>Generally, the CRA officer will examine your books and records at your place of business. The CRA officer may also examine them at an alternate location (for example: your authorized representative’s office or the officer will borrow your documents to complete the examination at a CRA office).</p>
          <h4> <span class="far fa-calendar-alt mrgn-rght-sm"></span> When to provide your documents</h4>
          <p>If your books and records are available electronically, the CRA officer may ask you to submit the documents online <strong>before or after meeting with you</strong>. This usually speeds up the examination process and leads to less time spent at your place of business.</p>
          <p>If electronic records are not available, or physical records are required, the CRA officer will either:</p>

                <summary>What if the CRA borrows your books and records</summary>
                <p>To borrow your books and records, the CRA officer will:</p>

                  <li>Complete a T2213 receipt identifying the borrowed books, records and documents</li>
                  <li>Provide you with a copy of the receipt</li>
                </ul>

          <p>If you cannot get the documents by the date requested, call the CRA officer assigned to your case at the number provided in your letter to request additional time. The CRA officer assigned to your case will determine if this is possible.</p>
          <p>If you no longer have specific books and records, the CRA officer can assist you in finding alternate methods to confirm the amounts reported on your slips and summaries. For example, you could obtain copies from a third party involved in a transaction (a financial institution or a supplier).</p>
