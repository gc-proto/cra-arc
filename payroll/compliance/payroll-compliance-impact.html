<p>The term “worker” is used on this page to refer to <strong>a current employee, a former employee, a retired employee or a self-employed worker.</strong></p>
 </div> </div>

<p>Following a payroll compliance review, a payroll trust accounts examination or an employer compliance audit, T4 or T4A slips may be corrected to reflect accurate income, withholdings, or other tax-related information of workers. This is done to make sure that employers or payers are fully compliant with their tax obligations for the period under review.</p>
<p>As a result of these corrections, <strong>changes to the worker’s</strong> previously filed <strong>personal income tax and benefit returns</strong> will be required. </p>

<details><summary><strong>Common corrections</strong> to T4 or T4A slips</summary>
<p>The CRA may amend the previously filed T4 or T4A slips to correct the reporting by the employer or payer by increasing or reducing the amount reported on the slip.</p>
<p>The CRA may also add T4 or T4A slips when a slip was not originally filed or when the employment status has been determined to be different from how it was reported on the original slip.</p>
<p>Changes are most commonly made to the following boxes or codes:</p>

    <h3 id="step2">Employer or payer distributes additional or amended T4 or T4A slips to the workers </h3>
     <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">The employer or payer <strong>must</strong> distribute the additional or amended T4 or T4A slips to the workers concerned. </p>

<p>Learn more about the obligation to distribute tax slips: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/file-information-returns-slip-summaries/distribute-slips.html">Distribute the slips</a></p>

<h4>Impact on taxes and benefits for workers</h4> 
<p>Changes to T4 or T4A slips can have a direct impact on a worker’s previously filed returns.</p>

<details><summary>Examples of impacts on <strong>taxes and benefits</strong></summary>
<p>The following are examples of changes to the T4 or T4A slips that can have a direct impact on previously filed <strong>personal income tax and benefit returns</strong>:</p>

<h4>Increased or decreased income</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned more</strong> than previously reported, their tax liability will increase, meaning they could owe more when their return is reassessed.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned less</strong> than previously reported, their tax liability will decrease, meaning they could owe less in taxes or be entitled to a larger tax refund when their return is reassessed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjustments to payroll deductions</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the correct amount of CPP contributions or EI premiums withheld were <strong>not</strong> originally <strong>reported</strong>, the changes will make sure the worker receives credit for the payroll deductions actually withheld. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the correct amount of CPP contributions or EI premiums were <strong>not</strong> originally <strong>withheld</strong>, the changes will make sure the correct payroll deductions are now reported, increasing the payroll deductions reported on the personal return. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If <strong>too much</strong> was initially withheld, the correction to the pensionable and insurable earnings could mean a lower balance owing or a larger refund as a result of a CPP or EI overpayment, depending on the circumstances. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Change in employment status</h4> 
<p>In addition to income and source deduction reporting corrections, changes to the T4 or T4A slip may have been made to correct how the worker’s employment status was reported:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>If the review determined that the worker was incorrectly treated as a self-employed worker instead of as an employee (or the reverse), this will result in their T4A slip being replaced with a T4 (or the reverse). </p>

<p>It will also impact whether CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions should have been withheld from their earnings.</p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>If the worker’s employment status was changed, this could change their tax obligations, eligibility for benefits, and even the source of income tax deductions they are entitled to claim. The worker may have to send a request to reassess their return to correct how they were claiming deductions on their return (either as business expenses or employment-related expenses).</p> </li>
</ul>

<h4>Tax credits and benefits</h4> 
<p>The amounts reported on the T4 or T4A slip affects eligibility for certain tax credits and government benefits (for example: Canada Child Benefit, GST/HST credits). </p>
<p> If the worker receives any government benefits, they should verify whether the revised income will impact these benefits. In some cases, it could lead to a reduction or an increase in benefits.</p>


</details>

<h4>What happens if the employer or payer does not distribute the T4 or T4A slips</h4>
<p>If the employer or payer <strong>does not</strong> distribute the T4 or T4A slips to the worker, the worker can get a copy from the CRA.</p>

<p>Learn more on how the worker can get a copy of the slip if they did not receive it: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/a-copy-your-tax-slips.html">Get a copy of your slips</a></p>

    <h3 id="step3">CRA makes a reassessment or worker sends a request to reassess their return</h3>
   
<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">Depending on the payroll compliance program, the CRA will make a reassessment to the worker’s previously filed <strong>personal income tax and benefit return</strong> or the worker will need to send a request to reassess their return. </p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-1 col-sm-1">
   <span class="fas fa-share-square fa-2x mrgn-rght-sm"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-11">
<p><strong>Even if the CRA reassesses the return,</strong> the worker may need to send a request to reassess their return to correct amounts entered on any other line of the return impacted by this reassessment. For example, to make corrections to amounts claimed as employment expenses or business expenses on their previously filed return. </p>

<details><summary>Common lines of the <strong>return</strong> impacted by a reassessment</summary>
<p>When a reassessment is done, the following are the most common lines of the <strong>personal income tax and benefit return</strong> that may be impacted:</p>
 <dl class="dl-horizontal mrgn-lft-md mrgn-tp-md">
 <dt>Line 10100 – Employment income</dt>  <dd>This line reports the total employment income from the T4 slips received by the worker. If there are adjustments to box 14 of the T4 slip, the income here will be updated accordingly. </dd>
  <dt>Line 10400 – Other employment income</dt>  <dd>This line reports amounts usually included on a T4A or T4PS slip. If there are other sources of employment income that should have been included on a T4 slip and were originally reported here by the worker, they will be removed from this line.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 15000 – Total income</dt>  <dd> This is the total income you report on the tax return. Any adjustments in the employment income or other sources of income will flow into this line.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 22215 - Deductions for enhanced CPP contributions on employment income</dt>  <dd> If there were errors in calculating enhanced CPP contributions, this line will reflect the correct deduction.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 23600 – Net income</dt>  <dd>Adjustments to the total income (from Line 15000) or deductions will affect this line, which shows the net income after deductions.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 30000 – Basic personal amount (federal tax credit)</dt>  <dd>Changes to net income may adjust the tax credit for the Basic Personal Amount.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 30800 – CPP contributions</dt>  <dd>If there were errors in calculating the CPP contributions (for example: due to an incorrect determination of employment status or incorrect income reporting), this line will reflect the corrected amount.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 31200 – EI premiums</dt>  <dd>  If there were errors in calculating the EI premiums (for example: due to an incorrect determination of employment status or incorrect income reporting), this line will reflect the corrected amount. </dd>
    <dt>Line 42000 – Net federal tax</dt>  <dd>If the taxable income changes, this will impact the amount of federal tax you owe. Any reassessment will adjust this line accordingly.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 42800 – Provincial or territorial tax</dt>  <dd>Depending on the province or territory, the provincial tax could also be affected by changes to the income or deductions.  </dd>
 <dt>Lines 48400 and 48500 – Refund or balance owing</dt>  <dd>After the reassessment, this line will reflect either a refund or balance owing based on the changes to the personal income tax and benefit return and taxes paid. </dd>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">If the worker receives an amended or additional slip from their employer or a payer, the worker <strong>must</strong> determine if:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The CRA reassessed their return</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They must send a request to reassess their previously filed return</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm if the CRA reassessed the worker’s return</h4>

 <p>To confirm if the CRA has reassessed the previously filed return, the worker can view the status of a notice of reassessment (NOR) using the CRA online services when they click “Tax returns” in the Navigation menu.</p>
<p>The “Notices of assessment and reassessment” table provides general information about the tax returns. The table provides detailed information when they click on the linked options under the columns “Status of return” and “Notice of Assessment or Reassessment”. </p> 

<p>If the “Status of return” column shows <strong>reassessed</strong>, the worker should review this notice to make sure the <strong>revised amounts match the changes made on the slips received</strong> from the employer or payer.</p>

<div class="row mrgn-tp-md">
<div class="col-xs-1 col-sm-1">
  <span class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-2x mrgn-rght-sm"></span> 
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-11">
<p>The CRA recommends waiting <strong>60 days</strong> after the employer or payer has distributed the additional or amended T4 or T4A slips provided by the CRA to the worker before sending a request to reassess a return. This is to make sure that the CRA does not already have a reassessment in progress.</p>
