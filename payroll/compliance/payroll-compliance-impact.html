  <div class="col-md-9">
<p>Following a payroll compliance review, examination or audit, T4 or T4A slips may be corrected to reflect accurate income, withholdings, or other tax-related information of employees or recipients. This is done to make sure that employers or payers are fully compliant with their tax obligations for the period under review.</p>
<p>As a result of these corrections, <strong>changes to the workers</strong> previously filed personal income tax and benefit returns will be required. </p>

  <li > <h3 id="step1">CRA provides additional or amended slips to the employer or payer</h3>
   
    <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">After a payroll compliance review, the CRA will provide additional or amended T4 or T4A slips if the review found the employer or payer failed to properly:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">
           
 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Report income</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Report taxable benefits </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Deduct CPP contributions </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Deduct EI premiums</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Determine the employment status of their workers</li>
</ul>
<details><summary><strong>Common corrections</strong> to T4 or T4A slips</summary>
<p>The CRA may amend the previously filed T4 or T4A slips to correct the reporting by the employer or payer by increasing or reducing the amount reported on the slip.</p>
<p>The CRA may also add T4 or T4A slips when a slip was not originally filed or when the employment status has been determined to be different from how it was reported on the original slip.</p>
<p>Changes are most commonly made to the following boxes or codes:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="h4">T4 slips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Total employment income (<strong>box 14</strong>)</li>

<li>CPP contributions (<strong>box 16</strong>)</li>
<li>EI premiums (<strong>box 18</strong>)</li>
<li>Insurable and pensionable earnings (<strong>box 24 and box 26</strong>)</li>
<li>Taxable benefits (<strong>codes 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 40 or 90</strong>)</li>

    <h3 id="step2">Employer or payer distributes additional or amended slips to the workers </h3>
     <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">The employer or payer <strong>must</strong> distribute the additional or amended T4 or T4A slips to the workers concerned. </p>

<p>Learn more about the obligation to distribute tax slips: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/file-information-returns-slip-summaries/distribute-slips.html">Distribute the slips</a></p>

<h4>Impact on taxes to workers</h4> 
<p>Changes to T4 or T4A slips can have a direct impact on previously filed returns.</p>

<details><summary>Examples of impacts on <strong>taxes</strong></summary>
<p>The following are examples of changes to the T4 or T4A slips that can have a direct impact on previously filed returns:</p>

<h4>Increased or decreased income</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned more</strong> than previously reported, their tax liability will increase, meaning they could owe more when their return is reassessed.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned less</strong> than previously reported, they may be entitled to a larger tax refund, or they might owe less in taxes when their return is reassessed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjustments to deductions</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the correct amount of CPP contributions or EI premiums withheld were <strong>not</strong> originally <strong>reported</strong>, the changes will make sure the worker receives credit for the deductions actually made. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the correct amount of CPP contributions or EI premiums were <strong>not</strong> originally <strong>withheld</strong>, the changes will make sure the correct deductions are now reported. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If <strong>too much</strong> was initially withheld, the correction to the pensionable and insurable earnings could mean a larger refund, depending on the circumstances. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Tax credits and benefits</h4> 
<p>The T4 or T4A slip affects eligibility for certain tax credits and government benefits (for example: Canada Child Benefit, GST/HST credits). Changes in the worker's reported income could impact the amounts they are entitled to receive. In some cases, it could lead to a reduction or an increase in benefits. </p>
<h5>Government benefits</h5> 
<p>If the worker receives any government benefits (such as the Canada Child Benefit or GST/HST credit), they should verify whether the revised income will impact these benefits. The worker may need to update their information with the CRA if they are impacted. </p>

<h4>Change in employment status</h4> 
<p>In addition to income and source deduction reporting corrections, changes to the T4 or T4A slip may have been made to correct how the worker’s employment status was reported:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the review determined that the worker was incorrectly treated as a self-employed worker instead of as an worker (or the reverse), this will result in their T4A slip being replaced with a T4 (or the reverse). It will also impact whether CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions should have been withheld from their earnings.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the worker’s employment status was changed, this could change their tax obligations, eligibility for benefits, and even the types of income tax deductions they are entitled to claim. For example, if they meet certain conditions, workers are entitled to claim certain employment-related expenses, while independent contractors may be able to deduct business expenses. </li>
</ul>
</details>

<h4>What happens if the employer or payer does not distribute</h4>
<p>If the employer or payer <strong>does not</strong> distribute the slips to the worker, the worker can get a copy from the CRA.</p>

<p>Learn more on how the worker can get a copy if they did not receive it: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/a-copy-your-tax-slips.html">Get a copy of your slips</a></p>

 <li>
    <h3 id="step3">CRA makes a reassessment or worker sends a request to reassess their return</h3>
   
<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">Depending on the payroll compliance program, the CRA will make the reassessment to the worker’s previously filed returns or the worker will need to make corrections to their return. </p>

<details><summary>Common lines of the <strong>personal income tax and benefit return</strong> impacted by a reassessment</summary>
<p>When a reassessment is done, the following are the most common lines of the <strong>personal income tax and benefit return</strong> that may be impacted:</p>
 <dl class="dl-horizontal mrgn-lft-md mrgn-tp-md">
 <dt>Line 10100 – Employment income</dt>  <dd>This line reports the total employment income from the T4 slips received by the worker. If there are adjustments to box 14 of the T4 slip, the income here will be updated accordingly. </dd>
  <dt>Line 10400 – Other employment income</dt>  <dd>If there are other sources of employment income that should have been included on a T4 slip and were originally reported here by the worker, they will be removed from this line.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 15000 – Total income</dt>  <dd> This is the total income you report on the tax return. Any adjustments in the employment income or other sources of income will flow into this line.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 22215 - Deductions for enhanced CPP contributions on employment income</dt>  <dd> If there were errors in calculating enhanced CPP contributions, this line will reflect the correct deduction.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 23600 – Net income</dt>  <dd>Adjustments to the total income (from Line 15000) or deductions will affect this line, which shows the net income after deductions.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 30000 – Basic personal amount (federal tax credit)</dt>  <dd>Changes to income may adjust the tax credit for the Basic Personal Amount.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 30800 – CPP contributions</dt>  <dd>If there were errors in calculating the CPP contributions (for example: due to an incorrect determination of employment status or incorrect income reporting), this line will reflect the corrected amount.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 31200 – EI premiums</dt>  <dd>  If there were errors in calculating the EI premiums (for example: due to an incorrect determination of employment status or incorrect income reporting), this line will reflect the corrected amount. </dd>
    <dt>Line 42000 – Net federal tax</dt>  <dd>If the total income changes, this will impact the amount of federal tax you owe. Any reassessment will adjust this line accordingly.  </dd>
    <dt>Line 42800 – Provincial or territorial tax</dt>  <dd>Depending on the province or territory, the provincial tax could also be affected by changes to the income or deductions.  </dd>
 <dt>Lines 48400 and 48500 – Refund or balance owing</dt>  <dd>After the reassessment, this line will reflect either a refund or balance owing based on the changes to the total income and taxes paid. </dd>
 <dt></dt>  <dd>  </dd>
        </dl>
</details>
<p>If the worker receives an amended or additional slip from their employer or a payer, the worker <strong>must</strong> determine if:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The CRA reassessed their return</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They must send a request to reassess their previously filed return</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm if the CRA reassessed the worker’s return</h4>

 <p>To confirm if the CRA has reassessed the previously filed return, the worker can view the status of a notice of reassessment (NOR) using the CRA online services when they click “Tax returns” in the Navigation menu.</p>
<p>The “Notices of assessment and reassessment” table provides general information about the tax returns. The table provides detailed information when they click on the linked options under the columns “Status of return” and “Notice of Assessment or Reassessment”. </p>
