<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">

<p>Following a payroll compliance review, examination or audit, T4 or T4A slips may be corrected to reflect accurate income, deductions, or other tax-related information. This is done to make sure that employers or payers are fully compliant with the tax obligations for the period under review.</p>
<p>As a result of these corrections, changes to previously filed T1 returns may be required. Depending on the situation, changes to T2 returns or GST/HST returns may also be required. </p>

<details><summary>Common corrections to T4 or T4A slips</summary>
<p>The CRA may amend the T4 or T4A slips to correct the reporting of the employer or payer by increasing or reducing the amount reported on the slip.</p>
<p>The CRA may also add T4 or T4A slips when a slip was not originally filed or when the employment status has been determined to be different from how it was reported on the original slip.</p>
<p>Changes are most commonly made to the following boxes or codes:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="h4">T4 slips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Total employment income (<strong>box 14</strong>)</li>
<li>Income tax deducted (<strong>box 22</strong>)</li>
<li>CPP contributions (<strong>box 16</strong>)</li>
<li>EI premiums (<strong>box 18</strong>)</li>
<li>Insurable and pensionable earnings (<strong>box 24 and box 26</strong>)</li>
<li>Taxable benefits (<strong>codes 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 40 or 90 </strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="h4">T4A slips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Self-employed commissions (<strong>box 020</strong>)</li>
<li>Income tax deducted (<strong>box 022</strong>)</li>

    <h3 id="step2"> Employer or payer distributes the slips to the workers </h3>
     <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">The employer or payer must distribute the slips to the workers concerned. </p>
<p>Depending on the payroll compliance program, the worker may consequently receive from the CRA a notice of reassessment as a result of the review, examination or audit. </p>
<details><summary>Examples - Impact on <strong>taxes</strong> to workers</summary>
<p>The T4 or T4A slip are used to report income and tax deductions to the CRA. Changes to these slips can have a direct impact on previously filed returns. For example:</p>

<h4>Increased or decreased income</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned more</strong> than previously reported, their tax liability may increase, meaning they could owe more when filing their return.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned less</strong> than previously reported, they may be entitled to a larger tax refund, or they might owe less in taxes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjustments to deductions</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the correct amount of tax, CPP, or EI contributions were <strong>not</strong> originally withheld, the changes will make sure the correct deductions are now reported. This may result in a smaller refund or additional taxes due. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If <strong>too much</strong> was initially withheld, the correction could mean a larger refund, depending on the circumstances. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Impact on tax credits and benefits</h4> 
<p>The T4 or T4A slip affects eligibility for certain tax credits and government benefits (for example: Canada Child Benefit, GST/HST credits). Changes in the worker's reported income could impact the amounts they are entitled to receive. In some cases, it could lead to a reduction or an increase in benefits. </p>

</details>
<details><summary>Examples - Impact on the <strong>worker classification</strong></summary>
<p>In addition to income and deduction corrections, changes to the T4 or T4A slip may also affect how the worker is classified, for example, if the review indicate that the worker status as an employee or contractor was incorrectly reported.</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the review determined that the worker was incorrectly classified as an independent contractor instead of an employee (or vice versa), this could result in adjustments to their slip. It may also impact the type of deductions (such as EI and CPP) that should have been withheld from their earnings. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the reclassification affects the worker's tax status, it could change their tax obligations, benefits eligibility, and even the types of deductions they are entitled to claim. For example, employees are entitled to claim certain employment-related expenses, while independent contractors may be able to deduct other business expenses. </li>
</ul></details>

    <h3 id="step3"> CRA makes reassessment or worker makes adjustments</h3>
     <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">Add info. </p>
<p>Depending on the situation, ... the CRA will make the reassessment to the previously filed returns or the worker will need to make corrections to their return.</p> 

<h4>When does the worker need to change previously filed returns</h4>
 <p>Add info here</p>
<p>This can be done by submitting a T1 Adjustment Request (T1-ADJ) form. The CRA will then reassess the tax return based on the updated information. </p>
<details><summary>Examples - Impact on <strong>tax liabilities</strong> to workers</summary>
<h4>Impact on tax liabilities</h4>
<p>If the changes result in an increase in the worker's income, they may owe additional taxes.</p>
<p>If the changes reduce their income, they may receive a larger refund. </p>
<p>In some cases, changes to CPP or EI deductions may lead to a balance owing or an adjustment in their tax credit eligibility. </p>
</details>
<details><summary>Examples - Impact on <strong>government benefits</strong> to workers</summary>
<p>If the worker receives any government benefits (such as the Canada Child Benefit or GST/HST credit), they should verify whether the revised income will impact these benefits. The worker may need to update their information with the CRA if they are impacted. </p>
