<p>Following a payroll compliance review, examination or audit, T4 or T4A slips may be corrected to reflect accurate income, withholdings, or other tax-related information of employees or recipients. This is done to make sure that employers or payers are fully compliant with their tax obligations for the period under review.</p>
<p>As a result of these corrections, changes to previously filed personal income tax and benefit returns will be required. Depending on the situation, changes to corporation income tax returns or GST/HST returns may also be required. </p>

    <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">The employer or payer receives a letter to inform them that the CRA has completed the review, examination or audit.</p>
<p>The CRA may also provide additional or amended T4 or T4A slips if they failed to properly: </p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
           
 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Report income</li>

<details><summary><strong>Common corrections</strong> to T4 or T4A slips</summary>
<p>The CRA may amend the previously filed T4 or T4A slips to correct the reporting by the employer or payer by increasing or reducing the amount reported on the slip.</p>
<p>The CRA may also add T4 or T4A slips when a slip was not originally filed or when the employment status has been determined to be different from how it was reported on the original slip.</p>
<p>Changes are most commonly made to the following boxes or codes:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">

    <h3 id="step2"> Employer or payer distributes the additional or amended slips to the workers </h3>
     <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">The employer or payer <strong>must</strong> distribute the additional or amended T4 or T4A slips to the workers concerned. </p>

<p>Learn more about the obligation to distribute tax slips: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/file-information-returns-slip-summaries/distribute-slips.html">Distribute the slips</a></p>

<h4>Impact on taxes to workers</h4> 
<p>Changes to T4 or T4A slips can have a direct impact on previously filed returns.</p>

<details><summary>Examples of impacts on <strong>taxes</strong></summary>
<p>The following are examples of changes to the T4 or T4A slips that can have a direct impact on previously filed returns:</p>

<h4>Increased or decreased income</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned more</strong> than previously reported, their tax liability will increase, meaning they could owe more when their return is reassessed.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the changes show that the worker <strong>earned less</strong> than previously reported, they may be entitled to a larger tax refund, or they might owe less in taxes when their return is reassessed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjustments to deductions</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the correct amount of CPP contributions or EI premiums withheld were <strong>not</strong> originally <strong>reported</strong>, the changes will make sure the employee receives credit for the deductions actually made. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the correct amount of CPP contributions or EI premiums were <strong>not</strong> originally <strong>withheld</strong>, the changes will make sure the correct deductions are now reported. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If <strong>too much</strong> was initially withheld, the correction to the pensionable and insurable earnings could mean a larger refund, depending on the circumstances. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Tax credits and benefits</h4> 
<p>The T4 or T4A slip affects eligibility for certain tax credits and government benefits (for example: Canada Child Benefit, GST/HST credits). Changes in the worker's reported income could impact the amounts they are entitled to receive. In some cases, it could lead to a reduction or an increase in benefits. </p>
<h5>Government benefits</h5> 
<p>If the worker receives any government benefits (such as the Canada Child Benefit or GST/HST credit), they should verify whether the revised income will impact these benefits. The worker may need to update their information with the CRA if they are impacted. </p>

<h4>Change in employment status</h4> 
<p>In addition to income and source deduction reporting corrections, changes to the T4 or T4A slip may have been made to correct how the worker’s employment status was reported:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the review determined that the worker was incorrectly treated as a self-employed worker instead of as an employee (or the reverse), this will result in their T4A slip being replaced with a T4 (or the reverse). It will also impact whether CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions should have been withheld from their earnings.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the worker’s employment status was changed, this could change their tax obligations, eligibility for benefits, and even the types of income tax deductions they are entitled to claim. For example, if they meet certain conditions, employees are entitled to claim certain employment-related expenses, while independent contractors may be able to deduct business expenses. </li>
</ul>
</details>

<h4>What happens if the employer or payer does not distribute</h4>
<p>If the employer or payer <strong>does not</strong> distribute the slips to the worker, the worker can get a copy from the CRA.</p>

<p>Learn more on how the worker can get a copy if they did not receive it: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/a-copy-your-tax-slips.html">Get a copy of your slips</a></p>

 <li>
    <h3 id="step3"> CRA makes a reassessment or the worker makes an adjustment request</h3>
   

<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">Depending on the payroll compliance program, the CRA will make the reassessment to the previously filed returns or the worker will need to make corrections to their return.</p> 

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="h4">CRA automatically reassess</h3>
 <p>The following CRA programs automatically reassess returns: </p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Assisted payroll compliance reviews (APCR)</li>
 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Employer compliance audits (ECA)</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Trust accounts examinations (TAE)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="h4">CRA does not automatically reassess</h3>
 <p>The following CRA programs do not automatically reassess returns: </p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Pensionable and insurable earnings review (PIER)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Common lines of specific returns impacted by a reassessment</h4>
<details><summary><strong>Personal</strong> income tax and benefit return</summary>
<p>When a reassessment is done, the following are the most common lines of the personal income tax and benefit return that may be impacted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line 10100 – Employment Income:</strong> This line reports the total employment income from the T4 slip. If there are adjustments to box 14 of the T4, the income here will be updated accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Line 10400 – Other Employment Income:</strong> If there are other sources of employment income that should have been included on a T4 slip and were originally reported here by the worker, they will be removed from this line.</li>
<li><strong>Line 20700 – Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Contributions:</strong> If there were errors in calculating the CPP contributions (for example: due to an incorrect determination of employment status or incorrect income reporting), this line will reflect the corrected amount.</li>
<li><strong>Line 22215 – ???:</strong> .</li>
<li><strong>Line 31200 – Employment Insurance (EI) Premiums:</strong> If there were errors in calculating the EI premiums (for example: due to an incorrect determination of employment status or incorrect income reporting), this line will reflect the corrected amount.</li>
<li><strong>Line 15000 – Total Income:</strong> This is the total income you report on the tax return. Any adjustments in the employment income or other sources of income will flow into this line.</li>
<li><strong>Line 23600 – Net Income:</strong> Adjustments to the total income (from Line 15000) or deductions will affect this line, which shows the net income after deductions.</li>
<li><strong>Line 26000 – Deductions:</strong> Any corrections to the CPP, EI, or other deductions will appear here. These deductions directly impact the taxable income.</li>
<li><strong>Line 30000 – Basic Personal Amount (Federal Tax Credit):</strong> Changes to the income may affect the eligibility for certain tax credits, including the Basic Personal Amount. This line will be adjusted based on the corrected income.</li>
<li><strong>Line 42000 – Federal Tax Payable:</strong> If the total income changes, this will impact the amount of federal tax you owe. Any reassessment will adjust this line accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Line 43500 – Provincial or Territorial Tax Payable:</strong> Depending on the province or territory, the provincial tax could also be affected by changes to the income or deductions.</li>
<li><strong>Line 47900 – Refund or Balance Owing:</strong> After the reassessment, this line will reflect either a refund or balance owing based on the changes to the total income and taxes paid.</li>
</ul></details>

<details><summary><strong>Corporation</strong> income tax return</summary>
<p>When a reassessment is done, the following are the most common lines of the corporation income tax return that may be impacted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line 100 – Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes:</strong> Adjustments to employment-related expenses or taxable benefits can change the corporation’s net income.</li>
<li><strong>Line 300 – Taxable Income:</strong> Changes in net income due to reassessment impact taxable income.</li>
<li><strong>Line 362 – Non-Deductible Expenses:</strong> For a personal services business (PSB), expenses disallowed due to the their status (such as certain business costs) are added here.</li>
<li><strong>Line 360 – Federal Tax Before Credits:</strong> Adjustments to taxable income affect federal tax calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Line 404 – Shareholder Benefits:</strong> This line specifically reports shareholder benefits. The reassessment may increase the amount reported here.</li>
<li><strong>Line 405 – Income (loss) before adjustments:</strong> For PSB, the increased taxable income from their classification is reflected here.</li>
<li><strong>Line 420 – Total Tax Payable:</strong> Changes in federal and provincial taxes lead to adjustments here.</li>
<li><strong>Line 450 – Federal Taxable Income:</strong> For PSB, the adjusted income after accounting for their related restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Line 450 – Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes:</strong> The shareholder benefit may increase net income, leading to higher tax liability.</li>
<li><strong>Line 479 – Federal Taxable Income:</strong> For shareholder benefit, adjustments to taxable income flow through to federal taxable income.</li>
<li><strong>Line 500 – Small Business Deduction:</strong> For PSB, they are not eligible for the small business deduction, so any amount claimed here must be removed.</li>
<li><strong>Line 610 – Federal Tax Payable:</strong> For PSB, they are subject to the general corporate tax rate without access to the small business deduction, increasing tax payable.</li>
<li><strong>Line 670 – Deductions for Employee Remuneration:</strong> Incorrect deductions related to employee salaries, wages, or bonuses may be corrected.</li>
<li><strong>Line 690 – Deductions for Employer Contributions to Pension Plans:</strong> Reassessments often review pension contributions and correct any discrepancies.</li>
<li><strong>Line 704 – Deductions for Other Employment-Related Costs:</strong> Any other eligible employment-related costs incorrectly claimed could be adjusted.</li>
<li><strong>Line 772 – Investment Tax Credits:</strong> If credits related to employee training or other employment incentives were claimed incorrectly, they may be adjusted.</li>
<li><strong>Line 780 – Provincial Tax Payable:</strong> Provincial tax may increase, as many provinces align their tax treatment with federal rules.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule 1 – Net Income (Loss) Adjustments:</strong> Employment-related deductions and taxable benefits adjustments are reconciled here.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule 8 – Capital Cost Allowance (CCA):</strong> Changes to asset costs related to employee use may be reviewed and adjusted.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule 50 – Shareholder Information:</strong> Adjustments to shareholder-employees’ compensation may impact this section.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule 1 – Adjustments for Non-Deductible Expenses:</strong> Any non-deductible employment expenses are corrected here.</li>
</ul></details>

<details><summary><strong>GST/HST</strong> return</summary>
<p>When a reassessment is done, the following are the most common lines of the GST/HST return that may be impacted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line 101 – Taxable Sales and Other Revenue:</strong> Taxable benefits provided to employees must be included in this line as they represent taxable supplies. If taxable benefits were previously omitted, this line will increase.</li>
<li><strong>Line 108 – GST/HST Collected or Collectible:</strong> Since taxable benefits are subject to GST/HST, this line will increase to reflect the additional GST/HST collected on the reassessed taxable benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Line 111 – Input Tax Credits (ITCs):</strong> If the CRA determines that ITCs were incorrectly claimed for expenses related to taxable benefits, adjustments must be made here by reducing the claimed ITCs.</li>
<li><strong>Line 115 – Adjustments:</strong> Any corrections for previously unreported taxable benefits, adjustments to ITCs, or other reassessment-related corrections should be reported here.</li>
<li><strong>Line 117 – Net Tax:</strong> The reassessment adjustments will affect the net tax calculation, increasing the amount the corporation owes or reducing the refund.</li>
<li><strong>Line 119 – Amount Owing or Refund:</strong> After accounting for all adjustments, this line will show the revised amount due or refund.</li>
<li><strong>Line 120 – Interest and Penalties:</strong> If the reassessment results in additional tax owing due to unreported taxable benefits, CRA may apply interest and penalties, which are reported here.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Details about the impact on taxable benefits</h4>
<p>When an employer provides a taxable benefit, it is considered a supply under GST/HST rules, and the employer must charge GST/HST on the fair market value of the benefit.</p>
<p>If the taxable benefit was not reported correctly, the CRA reassessment will require the taxpayer to report the benefit as taxable sales, collect and remit the appropriate GST/HST, and adjust any previously claimed input tax credits related to the benefit.</p>

        <details class="panel">
          <summary><span class="fas fa-file-invoice fa-xl mrgn-rght-sm"></span> CRA automatically reassess</summary>


 <p>If the worker’s return is automatically reassessed, the worker will receive a notice of reassessment with the balance owing, if applicable. The notice will provide a summary of the breakdown of that balance, including any previous arrears balance, and any penalties or interest applied to overdue payments.</p>
