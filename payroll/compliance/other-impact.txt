<h2 id="h_1">Changes to your slips after a payroll review, examination or audit</h2>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Why were changes made to your T4 or T4A Slip</h3>
<p>Following a payroll review, examination or audit, your T4 or T4A slip may have been revised to reflect accurate income, deductions, or other tax-related information. This makes sure that your employer or payer is in full compliance with the CRA requirements. Depending on the situation, this results in necessary corrections to previously filed slips.</p>
<p>The changes could include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Updated income figures</strong>: If there was any underreporting or overreporting of earnings, such as salary, bonuses, or commissions, the numbers on your T4 or T4A slip may have been corrected. </li>
<li><strong>Adjusted deductions</strong>: If the employer made errors in calculating deductions like Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions, Employment Insurance (EI), or income tax withholding, those have been rectified. </li>
<li><strong>Benefit or allowance adjustments</strong>: In some cases, employee benefits or allowances (for example: transportation, meals, or other taxable benefits) might have been adjusted to comply with tax laws. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you received a revised T4 or T4A slip, it is important to review the changes carefully.</p>
<h3 id="h_1_2">How will this affect your taxes</h3>
<p>Your T4 or T4A slip is used to report your income and tax deductions to the CRA. Changes to these slips can have a direct impact on your personal and income tax benefit return. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Increased or decreased Income</strong>: </li>
<li><strong>Increased income</strong>: If the changes show that you earned more than previously reported, your tax liability may increase, meaning you could owe more when filing your T1 return. </li>
<li>Decreased income: If the changes show that your income was overstated, you may be entitled to a larger tax refund, or you might owe less in taxes. </li>
<li><strong>Adjustments to deductions</strong>: </li>
<li><strong>Corrected tax withholdings</strong>: If the correct amount of tax, CPP, or EI contributions were not originally withheld, the changes will ensure the correct deductions are now reported. This may result in a smaller refund or additional taxes due. </li>
<li><strong>Over-deductions</strong>: If too much was initially withheld, the correction could mean a larger refund, depending on the circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Impact on tax credits and benefits</strong>: </li>
<li>Your T4 or T4A slip affects eligibility for certain tax credits and government benefits (for example: Canada Child Benefit, GST/HST credits). Changes in your reported income could impact the amounts you are entitled to receive. In some cases, it could lead to a reduction or an increase in benefits.<br /> </li>
</ol>
<h4>Impact on worker classification</h4>
<p>In addition to income and deduction corrections, changes to your T4 or T4A slip may also affect how you are classified as a worker. This is especially relevant if the audit revealed that your status as an employee or contractor was incorrectly reported.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Employee vs. self-employed classification</strong>: If the audit determined that you were incorrectly classified as an independent contractor instead of an employee (or vice versa), this could result in adjustments to your slip. It may also impact the type of deductions (such as EI and CPP) that should have been withheld from your earnings. </li>
<li><strong>Reclassification impact</strong>: If the reclassification affects your tax status, it could change your tax obligations, benefits eligibility, and even the types of deductions you are entitled to claim. For example, employees are entitled to claim certain employment-related expenses, while independent contractors may be able to deduct other business expenses. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_1_3">What should you do now<br />If the changes to your T4 or T4A slip affect your tax return or any other benefits, it's important to take the following steps:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Review the updated slip</strong>: Carefully compare the revised slip with your original one. Ensure that all changes are accurate and that you understand why they were made. </li>
<li><strong>Update your income tax and benefit return</strong>: </li>
<li><strong>If you've already filed</strong>: If your tax return has already been filed based on the original (incorrect) T4 or T4A slip, you will need to file an amended return with the CRA. This can be done by submitting a T1 Adjustment Request (T1-ADJ) form. The CRA will then reassess your tax return based on the updated information. </li>
<li><strong>If you haven't filed yet</strong>: Simply use the corrected T4 or T4A slip when completing your T1 tax return. </li>
<li><strong>Understand the financial impact</strong>: If the changes result in an increase in your income, you may owe additional taxes. If the changes reduce your income, you may receive a larger refund. In some cases, changes to deductions (like CPP or EI) may lead to a balance owing or an adjustment in your tax credit eligibility. Review the changes with a tax professional if you're unsure how they affect your situation. </li>
<li><strong>Monitor government benefits</strong>: If you receive any government benefits (such as the Canada Child Benefit or GST/HST credit), check whether the revised income will impact these benefits. You may need to update your information with the CRA if you're impacted. </li>
