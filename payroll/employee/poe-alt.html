</div>



<p>When you pay employment income such as salaries, wages, or commissions, the employee's province or territory of employment (POE) must be determined so that the proper deductions are withheld. This depends on whether your employee “reports for work” at any of your establishments.</p>
			 <p>The POE is <strong>determined by</strong>:</p>
			 
			<ul>
	<li>the type of income</li>
				 <li >the residency status</li>
				 <li >how the employee reports for work</li>
		   </ul>
<p>An <strong>establishment of the employer</strong> is <strong>any place or premises in Canada </strong>that is owned, leased or rented by an employer where employees report to work or from which employees are paid. For purposes of the POE, <strong>this does not need to be a permanent establishment</strong>.</p>

    <span class="fas fa-home fa-stack-1x"></span>
    <span class="fas fa-ban fa-stack-2x text-danger"></span>
  </span> Generally, the employer's home office is not considered an establishment of the employer.</p>
