<p>When you pay remuneration or employment income such as salaries, wages, or commissions, the employee's province or territory of employment (POE) must be determined so that the proper deductions are withheld. This depends on whether your employee “reports for work” at any of your establishments.</p>

			 <p>The POE is <strong>determined by</strong>:</p>
			 
			<ul>
	                         <li>The type of income</li>
				 <li>The residency status of the employee</li>
				 <li>The establishment of the employer where the employee reports for work</li>
		   </ul>
<p>For income tax, CPP and EI withholding purposes, an <strong>establishment of the employer</strong> is any place or premises in Canada that is owned, leased or rented by this employer where employees report to work or from which employees are paid. For purposes of the POE, this <strong>does not need to be a permanent physical location</strong>.</p>

              <div id="ajax-agreement">
<p>Generally, the CRA considers a full-time remote work agreement to exist between the employer and the employee when the following arrangements are made:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
                  <li class="cnjnctn-col">the agreement is <strong>either </strong>temporary or permanent </li>

</ul>
<p>The <strong>employer and the employee must be able to justify</strong> that a full-time remote work agreement was made.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this policy, the term <strong>“employee”</strong> refers to an employee who <strong>does not have to report for work at an establishment of their employer</strong>, such as a full-time teleworker or a travelling representative.</p>

<li><details><summary>Determine if the employee is reasonably <strong>considered to be "attached to an establishment of the employer"</strong></summary>

<p id="step2">Once you have determined that a full-time remote work agreement was made, you need to determine whether the employee is reasonably considered to be "attached to an establishment of the employer".</p>
<div id="ajax-attached2"> 
<p class="mrgn-bttm-md"> <strong>This determination must be done based on a thorough review of the facts in each specific case.</strong></p>

<h4 class="mrgn-tp-lg">Primary indicator</h4>
<p>The primary indicator to determine if an employee can reasonably be considered "attached to an establishment of the employer" is whether the employee would physically come to work to carry out the functions related to their employment duties at that establishment, if it was not for the full-time remote work agreement. </p>
<p>For employees who physically reported to an establishment of the employer <strong>immediately before </strong>entering a full-time remote work agreement, that establishment is the one to which they would be reasonably considered to be attached, unless the employee's circumstances or the nature of their duties have changed.</p>
<h4>Secondary indicators </h4>
<p>The following secondary indicators can assist you to determine the establishment of the employer where the employee, if it was not for the full-time remote work agreement, would physically come to work to carry out the functions related to their employment duties:<p>
<ol>
<li>The establishment where the employee attends or would attend in-person meetings, through any type of communication </li>
<li>The establishment where the employee receives or would receive work-related material or equipment or associated instructions and assistance</li>
<li>The establishment where the employee comes or would come in person to receive instructions from their employer regarding their duties, through any type of communication </li>
<li>The establishment that is responsible for or supervises the employee, as indicated in the contractual agreements between the employer and the employee </li>
<li>The establishment to which the employee would report based on the nature of the duties performed by the employee </li>
</ol>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md">Generally, <strong>all the indicators</strong> need to be reviewed together in order to determine whether the employee is reasonably considered to be "attached to an establishment of the employer".</p>

<p>All of the indicators do not have to point to the same establishment, but it must be <strong>clear</strong> in reviewing the indicators that there is <strong>only 1 establishment</strong> to which the employee can be reasonably considered to be attached.</p>

<h5>What is considered a reasonable attachment determination</h5>
<p>To be considered “reasonable” by the CRA, your determination that the employee is attached to an establishment based on the indicators above <strong>must</strong> be supported by the facts of your employee’s employment situation. This determination <strong>cannot</strong> be used to avoid source deductions or employer contributions in a province or territory.</p>

<h5>More than 1 establishment of the employer</h5>
<p>If your employee can be reasonably considered attached to more than 1 establishment of the employer, the same indicators should be used to determine to which establishment of the employer the employee can be reasonably considered to be <strong>more closely attached</strong> to.</p>

<div id="ajax-6criteria">

 <details><summary>Scenario - Employee reasonably considered to be attached to an establishment</summary>
<p>The following example illustrates the application of the indicators by looking at a single factor in each. Generally, more than one indicator will indicate that the employee can be reasonably considered to be attached to the establishment of the employer.</p>
             
<p>Employee A works in the company's IT department as a systems analyst. The company has offices in several Canadian provinces. Their contract includes a remote work agreement allowing them to work from their home office in Manitoba 100% of the time. </p>
