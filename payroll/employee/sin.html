  </ul>

<h2 id="h-1">Who should provide you with their SIN</h2>
<p>Individuals <strong>must </strong>obtain and provide the 9-digit number known as a Social Insurance Number (SIN) when starting employment. Service Canada is responsible for issuing SINs.</p>

<p>A temporary SIN is issued to visitors, permit holders, refugees, and temporary workers who are legally entitled to work in Canada. These numbers begin with a 9 and have an expiry date.</p>
<p>Learn more on the <strong>individual's responsibilities</strong> to obtain a SIN prior to working in Canada from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC): <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/qualify.html">Who needs a Social Insurance Number (SIN)</a></p>

<h2 id="h-2">When to get the SIN from the individual</h2>
<p>You have to get the social insurance number (SIN) from the individual <strong class="nowrap">within 3 days </strong>of when they start to work for you.</p>
<p>If the individual does not have a SIN when they start working for you, they have to apply for one and give it to you <strong class="nowrap">within 3 days </strong>after they receive it.</p>

<p>Learn more on <strong>your responsibilities</strong> from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC): <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/ei-employers-sin.html">Employer information - Social Insurance Number (SIN)</a></p>

<h2 id="h-3">What if you do not receive the SIN from the individual</h2>		 
<p>If the individual does not give you their SIN, you need to:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">Show that you made a <strong>reasonable effort </strong>to get it.<details class="mrgn-bttm-md mrgn-lft-lg mrgn-tp-md"><summary>Examples of what is a reasonable effort</summary>
<p>After asking the individual for their SIN many times, you decide to contact them in writing to request their SIN. You made notes of the dates you asked for the SIN verbally, and keep copies of any written requests.</p>
</details></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Inform Service Canada <strong>within six days </strong>of the individual starting to work for you that they did not give their SIN. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Still start calculating and withholding payroll deductions if the individual works for you. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Suggest to the individual to contact Service Canada and consult <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/qualify.html">Who needs a SIN</a>.</li>

<p>A $100 penalty may apply if the employer or payer failed to show reasonable attempts to obtain a SIN.</p>

  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Individual</h4>
    <p>A $100 penalty may apply if the individual failed to provide their SIN when required.</p>

 
  </li>
</ul>
	   
<h2 id="h-4">After receiving the SIN</h2>
<p>Make sure the individual gives you their correct name and SIN. You may ask for other types of identification, such as a birth certificate or a certificate of citizenship or permanent residence, before finalizing their employment documents. <strong>An incorrect SIN can affect an individual's future Canada Pension Plan benefits if their record of earnings is not accurate</strong>. </p>

<h3>Situation: Individual is a non-resident</h3>
	
<p id="after">You need to make sure that all individuals who have a SIN beginning with a "9" are authorized to work in Canada and that their work permit has not expired. </p>
<p>If the immigration document has expired, ask the employee to contact Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to get a valid document. You can advise your employee to consult, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/receiving-updating.html">What to do if your temporary SIN expires</a>).</p>
