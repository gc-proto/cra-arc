  <h2 id="h-0">When to fill out the TD1 forms</h2>
  <p>Employers and payers must get the completed TD1 forms from the individual:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
    <li class="cnjnctn-col">when the employee starts work</li>
    <li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>within 7 days</strong>&nbsp;of a change to the individual's situation that may reasonably be expected to result in a change to the individual's personal tax credits for the year</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individuals do <strong>not</strong> have to fill out a new TD1 form every year unless there is a change to their federal, provincial or territorial personal tax credit amounts.</p>

  <h2 id="h-7">When the employee has multiple employers</h2>
  <p>If an employee has more than one employer or payer at the same time and has already claimed personal tax credit amounts on another TD1 form, the employee&nbsp;<strong>cannot claim them again</strong>. If the employee’s total income from all sources will be&nbsp;<strong>more&nbsp;</strong>than the personal tax credits claimed on another TD1 form, they must check the box “More than one employer or payer at the same time” on page 2 of the TD1 form, enter “0” on line 13 on page 1 and not fill in lines 2 to 12.</p>

    <h3 id="h_0_1">How to fill out and send the TD1X</h3>
    <p>When filling out the TD1X, the employee will estimate their income and expenses by using <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>

      <li class="cnjnctn-col">the previous year’s income and commissions expenses amounts, if employees were paid by commission at any time that year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The employee must give the TD1X to the employer no later than, <strong>one </strong>of the following:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">one month of the date their employment starts</li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">January 31 if with the same employer as the previous year</li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">one month after the date on which a change occurs that may reasonably be expected to result in a change to the individual's estimated deductions for the year</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>How to revoke the TD1X</h3>
    <p>The employee can revoke the TD1X at any time during the year by notifying their employer in writing. Once revoked, the employer will deduct tax using the total claim amount on the&nbsp;<strong>TD1</strong>.</p>

  <h2 id="h-4">What if you do not receive the TD1 forms</h2>
  <p>If an individual does not give the completed TD1 form, the individual's tax deductions will only include the basic personal amount you estimated based on their income. You still need to:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
    <li class="cnjnctn-col">determine which tax tables to use</li>
    <li class="cnjnctn-col">calculate deductions and remit them by the due date</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Penalties</h3>
  <p>If the individual does <strong>not </strong>provide you with the TD1 form when required, they are liable to a penalty of $25 for each day the form is late. The minimum penalty is $100, and increases by $25 per day to a maximum of $2,500.</p>
  <h2 id="h-5">After receiving the TD1 forms</h2>
  <p>You need to:</p>
  <ol class="lst-stps">
    <li>Review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the individual has not included any <strong>additional </strong>information (for example, requesting additional tax to be deducted).</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>from the TD1 form to calculate the correct amount of federal and provincial or territorial income tax deductions.</li>
    <li>Keep the completed forms with the individual's records. Do <strong>not </strong>send the CRA a copy.</li>
    <li>Determine which tax tables to use.</li>
    <li>Calculate deductions and remit them by the due date.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A new form will be required within <strong>7 days </strong>of any changes to the individual's personal tax credits.</p>
  <p>Learn more on what to do when an individual wants to increase or reduce income tax deductions, and what to do if an individual's life situation changes their personal tax credits: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/set-up-new-employee/increase-reduce-income-tax-deducted-source.html">Increase or reduce income tax deducted at source</a>.</p>
  <h3>Your responsibility</h3>
  <p>It is a serious offence to knowingly accept a TD1 that contains false or deceptive statements. If you think that the TD1 has false information, you must deduct taxes after allowing the basic personal amount <strong>only</strong>.</p>
