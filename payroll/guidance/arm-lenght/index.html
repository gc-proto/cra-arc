      <p>Workers usually fall into one of two categories:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or  cnjnctn-sm mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li class="cnjnctn-col"> An <strong>employee</strong>
          <details class="mrgn-tp-md">
            <summary>What is an employee</summary>
            <p>Generally, <strong>an employee</strong> is hired to  perform work under the direction and control of the individual or corporaation who hires  them under a contract of service (employer/employee relationship). Under the  terms and conditions of employment, an employee does not normally have the  chance to make a profit or suffer a loss. An employee is not seen as operating  their own business, but rather as being an integral part of the payer&rsquo;s  business. An employee may be entitled to benefits, be paid for vacation time,  or be covered by a collective agreement.</p>
          </details>
        </li>
        <li class="cnjnctn-col"> A <strong>self-employed worker</strong>
          <details class="mrgn-tp-md">
            <summary>What is a self-employed worker</summary>
            <p>A <strong>self-employed worker</strong> carries on their own business. A self-employed worker enters into a contract for services (business relationship) with the individual or corporation (the payer) they provide a service to. In this relationship, the self-employed worker agrees to provide a service, and is free to choose the means of performing the contract. A self-employed worker is not under the direction or control of the payer.</p>
          </details>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use this guidance if you are:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A payer or employer</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A worker</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It will help you understand how to determine a  worker's employment status.</p>
      <p>Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs; however, the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship. In other words, it is all of the facts, including the actual terms and conditions of employment, that determine a worker’s employment status, not just the intention.</p>
