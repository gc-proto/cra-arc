<p id="step3">A trust is a person. The rules for determining if a trust is related to another person are the <strong>same as for other persons</strong>.</p>
 <details><summary>Types of trust and explanation</summary> 
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12">
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Bare trust</dt><dd>A bare trust exists where a trustee is merely vested with the legal title to property and has no other duty to perform or responsibilities to carry out as trustee, in relation to the property vested in the trust.
<br> 
<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p>A trust that is considered to be a bare trust acts as agent for the beneficiary. The CRA considers the beneficiary is the person dealing with other parties with respect to the trust property.</p>
<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>The sole duty of a bare trustee is to convey legal title to the trust property on demand, on the instructions of the beneficial owner (beneficiary). The bare trustee does not have any independent power, discretion or responsibility pertaining to the trust property. The beneficiary retains the right to control and direct the trustee in all matters relating to the trust property.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>123 Property Trust holds property for A Corp (the beneficiary). The beneficiary directs the trustee in all matters relating to the property. The trustee does not have any independent power, discretion or responsibility pertaining to the property.</p>
<p>It is likely that 123 Property Trust is a bare trust. The benficiary instructs 123 Property Trust to transfer the property to B Corp. A Corp and B Corp are related to each other. </p>
<p>Because A Corp and B Corp are related to each other, the transfer of the property is a non-arms-length transaction.</p>
<p>Had the role of the trustee been different, for example, if the trustee had discretionary power or responsibility to manage the property, the trust would not be a bare trust. In that case, if 123 Property Trust was not related to B Corp, the transaction would be at arm's length.</p></details>
 </dd>
<dt>Testamentary trust</dt><dd>A testamentary trust is a trust or estate that is generally created on and as result of the death of the person. 
</dd>
<dt>Personal trust</dt><dd><p>A personal trust (for 2016 and subsequent tax years) means:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trust that arose on and as a consequence of the individual's death if it meets the conditions to be a graduated rate estate</li>
<li>A trust in which no beneficial interest was acquired for consideration payable to the trust or to any person or partnership that has made a contribution to the trust</li>
</ul> 
<br> 
<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p>A personal trust is a specified personal trust if it is <strong>not </strong>described in paragraphs 108(1)(a) to (e.1).</p>

<p> A beneficiary <strong>does not</strong> deal at arm's length with the trust from which it acquired property in accordance with the terms of the will of the deceased.</p>
<p> Additionally, 2 or more specified personal trusts are deemed <strong>not</strong> to deal at arm's length in either of the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The same person is a beneficiary of each trust</li>

</li>
	
<li> <h3>Identify the persons</h3>
<p>Determine who the unrelated persons are in the transaction. These individuals or entities should not have any pre-existing close relationships that might influence the transaction.</p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Understand arm's length transaction</h3>
<p>Arm's length transactions are those conducted as if the parties were unrelated. They involve fair market value exchanges, with terms and conditions that would be expected in a typical business transaction.</p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Examine the transaction</h3>
<p>Review the specific transaction between the unrelated parties. This could be a sale of property, provision of services, or any financial arrangement.</p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Assess fair market value</h3>
<p>Determine whether the transaction is consistent with what would be expected in a fair market transaction between unrelated parties. Consider factors such as price, terms, and conditions.</p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Analyze the nature of the relationship</h3>
<p>Verify that there is no special or close relationship between the parties that could affect the terms of the transaction. Close family ties, shared business interests, or a significant level of control over each other's affairs may raise concerns. </p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Review documentation</h3>
<p>Check for documentation that supports the arm's length nature of the transaction. Adequate contracts, invoices, and records of negotiations can help demonstrate arm's length dealings.</p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Review transfer pricing rules (if applicable)</h3>
<p>If the parties involved are business entities, understand any applicable transfer pricing rules. These regulations ensure that transactions between unrelated entities are priced fairly based on the open market. </p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Document the transaction</h3>
<p>Maintain detailed records of the transaction, including any evidence that supports the arm's length nature of the deal. Documentation is crucial in case of a tax audit. </p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Comply with tax reporting</h3>
<p>If the transaction is determined to be at arm's length, report it accurately on your tax returns. Ensure that you're compliant with any tax laws and regulations relevant to the transaction. </p>
</li> 
<li> <h3>Maintain ongoing compliance</h3>
<p>Regularly assess transactions between unrelated parties to ensure they continue to meet arm's length standards, especially if the relationship between the parties changes. It's important to remember that arm's length transactions are fundamental for preventing tax avoidance or evasion. Ensuring that transactions between unrelated parties are conducted fairly and without undue influence is a key aspect of tax compliance. Proper documentation and adherence to tax regulations are essential in this process. </p>
