<h2 id="h_1">What is a PSB</h2>	
<p>The CRA is working to help Canadian corporations carrying on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> and the businesses that hire them to better understand their tax obligations.</p>
<div id="ajax-psbinfo"> 
<p>Generally, a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> exists where a corporation carries on a business of providing services and the individual performing the work would be considered to be an employee of the payer if it were not for the existence of the corporation through which they are performing the services. The person performing the services for the corporation is referred to as an <strong>incorporated employee</strong>.</p>
  </div>
<p>The CRA might consider your corporation to be carrying on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> if <strong>all conditions are met</strong>.</p>

<p>Learn more about the conditions: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/emp-status/factors-psb.html">Determine if the worker’s corporation is carrying on a PSB</a></p>

<h3 id="h_4">Examples of common types of industries where <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>s are commonly used</h3>	
<p>In some industries, such as the following, it is a more common practice for payers to require individuals to incorporate in order to provide services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Construction </li>
<li>Trucking, transportation and warehousing</li>
<li>Professional, scientific, and technical services </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_2">Payer and payee relationship</h2>	
<p>If your business uses a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> or you carry on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>, your tax obligations are different from those of an employer and employee. Your tax obligations are based on whether you are a:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Payer</h4>	<p>The business receiving the services is considered the payer (a person or business who pays the worker or corporation for their services).</p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Payee</h4> <p>The corporation carrying on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> receiving the payment for those services is considered the payee.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_3">Why is it important to determine if your corporation is carrying on a PSB</h2>	
<p>It is important to determine if your corporation is carrying on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> because special rules may apply to your corporation for income tax purposes if you perform services for the payer on behalf of a corporation owned by you or someone related to you. </p>
<p>For example, the income earned from carrying on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> is not eligible for the general tax reduction or the small business deduction, which allow certain other corporations to reduce their corporate tax rates. <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>s are also subject to an additional 5% tax and are limited in the types of expenses they may deduct from their income.</p>

<h2 id="h_4">Help for small businesses</h2>
<p>If you are a small business that would like help in understanding your tax obligations, you can ask for a visit from a Canada Revenue Agency Liaison Officer. </p>

<h3 id="h_1-1">More help if you are carrying on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr></h3>
<p>The CRA is conducting an educational outreach project to help businesses that use or carry on a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> understand and comply with their tax obligations associated with this type of arrangement.</p>
<p>Learn more on the results from phase 1 of the <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> pilot: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-income-tax-return/personal-services-business-pilot.html">Personal services business pilot</a></p>
