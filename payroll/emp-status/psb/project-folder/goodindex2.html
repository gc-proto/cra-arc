<h1>Worker vs. payer questionnaire comparison<br/>
<small>Questionnaire to determine if the worker's corporation was carrying on a personal services business (PSB)</small>
</h1>
<details open><summary>Step-by-step instructions</summary>
<p>To use the comparison tool:</p>
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
<li>Upload both worker and payer JSON files.
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><label>Worker's response:</label>
<input accept=".json" id="jsonWorkerInput" type="file"/></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><label>Payer's response:</label>
<input accept=".json" id="jsonPayerInput" type="file"/></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>View side-by-side results.<br>
<small> To help you quickly spot mismatches between the 2 responses, if the worker and payer answers are different, the cells will be highlighted in <span style="background-color: #fff3cd;">yellow</span>.</small></li>
<li>Begin your full analysis using each factors. 
<p class="small">Each PSBCR case is unique and requires a thorough review of the facts to determine if the worker’s corporation was carrying on a personal services business for the period under review. The purpose of this questionnaire is to review the following condition for worker's corporation to have been carrying on a PSB:</p>
<p class="small mrgn-lft-lg">If the corporation did not exist, the worker would <strong>reasonably be considered an employee</strong> of the payer (the corporation’s client) to whom the services were provided.</p>
<p class="small">The questionnaire is using the following icons to show whether the answers suggest the worker would be considered:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled small">
<li class="mrgn-lft-lg"><i class="fas fa-users" style="color: green;" title="Contract of service"></i> Contract of service (employment)</li>
<li class="mrgn-lft-lg"><i class="fas fa-user-tie" style="color: #004085;" title="Contract for services"></i> Contract for services (self-employed worker)</li>
<li class="mrgn-lft-lg"><i class="fas fa-not-equal" style="color: grey;" title="Neutral"></i> Neutral</li>
<li class="mrgn-lft-lg"><i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #a2bffe;" title="Information to help with the contract review"></i> Information to help with the contract review</li>
</ul>
<p class="small mrgn-tp-lg">Depending on the situation for this review, the icons may not always apply. To make a final decision, you need to review all indicators together, along with the documents sent by both the payer and the worker.</p>
