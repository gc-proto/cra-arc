<p>It is the obligation of the taxpayer, the employer and the payee to report the income accurately. The employer can correct a <strong>reporting error</strong>.</p>
<p> The employer <strong>cannot change the nature of the income paid </strong>(for example, from salary to dividends). This is considered retroactive tax planning and is viewed as inaccurately changing the reporting of the income.</p>
<p>Generally, there is no time limit to amend slips. When you file slips, the amounts reported for CPP, EI and income tax are deemed to have been deducted, and <strong>do not </strong>fall under the "statute barred" rules. </p>
