</ul> 
<details> <summary>Brief description</summary>
<p>A new category has been created for virtual social events. Virtual social events can be provided by an employer for its employees and not be considered to be a taxable benefit as long as the cost per employee is $50 or less when only hospitality is provided, or $100 or less where both hospitality and entertainment are provided. Where the event is both in-person and virtual, for administrative convenience, the current cost limit per person of $150 will apply.</p>
