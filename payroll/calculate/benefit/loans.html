<h5>Home purchase loan</h5>
 <div id="ajax-purchase">
 <p>A home purchase loan is any part of a loan to an employee that the employee used to get or repay another loan to buy a residence. The residence has to be for that employee, or a person related to that employee. This also applies to a shareholder, or a person related to a shareholder.</p>

<p>Loans received or debts incurred because of shareholdings may give rise to an interest benefit when <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">

  <li class="cnjnctn-col">  The loan is received, or the debt is incurred, by a person or partnership (except when the person is a corporation resident in Canada, or the partnership is one in which each partner is a corporation resident in Canada)</li>

 <details><summary>Payroll advances you provide related to employment</summary>
<p>If you make a payroll advance to your employee on account of their future earnings, the advance is generally not considered to be a loan for the purposes of subsection 80.4(1) of the Income Tax Act. </p>
<p>An advance on account of future earnings is a payment for salary, wages or commissions that an employee is expected to earn by the performance of future services. Such advances are generally considered to be employment income in the year they are received.</strong></p>

</details>

 <details><summary>Loans you provide that are equivalent to an anticipated workers' compensation award</summary>
 <p>To determine if advances or loans made to an employee, that are equivalent to an anticipated workers' compensation award, are a taxable benefit, refer to <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/payment/wcb.html">Payments related to workers' compensation claims</a>.</p>

 </details>

<details><summary>Loans or debts that are forgiven </summary>
 <div id="ajax-forgivable">
<p> A forgiven loan is where all or part of an existing loan or debt has been forgiven. The amount that has been forgiven in the tax year is considered to be income for that tax year.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>CRA's administrative policy does not apply</strong> to forgiven loans or debts. The amount forgiven is <strong>always</strong> taxable. </p>

<details><summary>Forgivable loans</summary>
<p>Forgivable loans are types of loans that allow borrowers to have the balance of the loan partially or totally forgiven if they meet certain conditions.</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Received because of employment</h4>
<p>Forgivable loans received because of employment that are subsequently forgiven are considered to be employment income at the time they were forgiven. If a loan is <strong>partially</strong> forgiven, <strong>only</strong> the forgiven <strong>portion</strong> is included in their income. </p></li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Received because of shareholdings</h4>
<p>Forgivable loans received because of shareholdings that are subsequently forgiven are not considered to be employment income even though the shareholder is also an employee at the time the loan was forgiven. Instead, the forgiven amount is considered as income received by the person in their capacity as a shareholder. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details><summary>Forgivable loans specific to pursuing education or research</summary>
<p>If you provide an employee with a forgivable loan to enable them to pursue education or research on the condition that they return to employment with you, the amount is generally not included in their income at the time they receive it. If the loan (or part of the loan) is later forgiven for the reason that the employment conditions were met, the forgiven part would be included as employment income in the year it was forgiven.</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Repayable award</summary>
<p>Repayable awards are different from forgivable loans. If you provide your employee with a repayable award which is <strong>not</strong> for education or training that is primarily for the benefit of the employer, the amount is considered employment income and must be included on the T4 slip <strong>in the year received</strong>.</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The interest rate on the loan or debt equals, or is more than, the rate that would have been agreed upon in an arm's length transaction at the time the loan or debt arose if the creditor's ordinary business included the lending of money.

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>You include all or part of the loan or debt in the income of a person or partnership. Where only part of the loan or debt has been included in income, an interest benefit must still be calculated for the portion of the loan or debt that remains outstanding. </p>

 <h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
 <p>If the loan is received or the debt is incurred <span class="nowrap"><a href="#emp" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">because of employment&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>,</span> the <strong>interest benefit is not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and ">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Total amount of all loans received is <strong>$10,000 or less per calendar year</strong> (includes loans of different term durations and principal amounts)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Term of the loan(s) is <strong>60 days or less</strong></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Loan is <strong>not</strong> received <a href="#share" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">because of shareholdings&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a></li>

</ul>

<p>If the term of the loan spans 2 calendar years, the loan will count as part of the $10,000 limit for the year in which the loan was received.</p>

<p>If the loan is considered received <strong> because of shareholdings</strong>, the CRA administrative policy <strong>does not</strong> apply.</p>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the loan <strong>does not meet all of the conditions above</strong>, the <strong>interest benefit</strong> is taxable.</p>

<p>If the <strong>full principal</strong> of the loan is <strong>not repaid within 60 days</strong>, the <strong>full</strong> interest benefit received by the employee is taxable. You will need to report this amount on a T4 slip in the year the loan is received.</p>

<p>If <strong>interest was paid by the employer (or intended employer) or any other person (other than the debtor) related to the employer</strong> which has not been reimbursed in the year, you need to report this amount in code 40 and in box 14.</p>
	<p>The loan does not need to be outstanding at the end of the borrower’s tax year for a benefit to be calculated. If the employee makes a payment during the period, then two separate calculations are required for the period. Each calculation is based on the declining balance of the loan as payments are made.  </p>

<details><summary>Example - Calculations</summary>
<p>On March 4, 20X1, Steve borrowed $250,000 from his employer as a low interest loan at a 1% interest rate. In 20X1, the prescribed interest rates were: 3% for 1st quarter, 3% for 2nd quarter, 4% for 3rd quarter and 5% for 4th quarter.</p>
<p>Steve made a payment on principal balance of $25,000 on August 1, 20X1.</p>
<p>A company related to the employer (3rd party) paid $2,000 in interest on Steve's loan on December 1, 20X1. Steve repaid $750 of this amount during the year.</p>
<p>Steve made an interest payment of $1,900 on January 15, 20X2 (within 30 days after the end of the year). </p>

<p>If <strong>interest was paid by the employer (or intended employer) and any other person (other than the debtor) related to the employer</strong> which has not been reimbursed in the year, you need to report this amount in code 40 and in box 14.</p>

<p>The loan does not need to be outstanding at the end of the borrower’s tax year for a benefit to be calculated. If the employee makes a payment during the period, then two separate calculations are required for the period. Each calculation is based on the declining balance of the loan as payments are made.  </p>

<details><summary>Example - Calculations</summary>
<p>On January 1, 20X1, Judith borrowed $100,000 from her employer. This was to purchase a condo which will be Judith's personal residence and for this example, the loan qualifies as a home relocation loan. The loan is repayable in 25 years and the term is 6 years with an interest rate of 2%. The prescribed interest rates were: 3% for 20X1, 3% for 20X2, 1% for 20X3, 3% for 20X4, 3% for 20X5 and 4% for 20X6.</p>
<p>Judith made interest payments of $2,000 in 20X1, $2,000 in 20X2 and $1,800 in 20X3, each on December 30 of the respective year. Judith also made a payment on principal balance of $10,000 on January 1, 20X3.</p>
<p>Judith made interest payments of $1,600 in 20X4, $1,400 in 20X5 and $1,000 in 20X6, each on December 30 of the respective year. Judith also made payments on principal balance of $10,000 on January 1, 20X4, $10,000 on January 1, 20X5 and $20,000 on January 1, 20X6.</p>
<p> The prescribed interest rates did not change from quarter to quarter during these tax years. No interest payments were made by the employer or any party related to the employer.</p>

<p>Angele is a shareholder of 631 Inc and the company provided him with a $55,000 loan on January 1, 20X0 by virtue of her shareholdings. The loan is repayable in 10 years with an interest rate of 1.5%. Assume that subsection 15(2) <strong>does not</strong> apply to this particular loan and that in 20X1, the prescribed rates were: 3% for the 1st quarter, 3% for the 2nd quarter, 4% for the 3rd quarter and 5% for the 4th quarter. Angele made no payments on the principal balance in 20X1 and made a $200 interest payment in each quarter.</p>
