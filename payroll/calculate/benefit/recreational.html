<h2 id="h_1">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h2>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-lg">Generally, recreational facility memberships you provide or pay on behalf of your employees are taxable. Depending on your situation, the benefit may not be taxable under the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. </p>
<details><summary>What is a recreational facility</summary>
<p>A recreational facility's main purpose is to provide social or recreational activities and fitness, sports, or dining facilities. It includes, but is not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
<li>social or activities clubs </li>
<li>sports or athletic clubs (such as golf, yacht or racket clubs) </li>
<li>fitness clubs (such as Nautilus, Holiday Fitness, etc.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of recreational facilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>exercise rooms </li>
<li>swimming pools </li>
<li>gymnasiums </li>
<li>tennis, squash or racquetball courts </li>
<li>golf courses </li>
<li>shuffleboard facilities </li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary>What is a club</summary>
<p>Private clubs, professional clubs, golf clubs and similar associations or organizations (such as The Canadian Club, The Railway Club, The Oilmen's Club, etc.) are considered clubs. Such clubs may operate fitness, recreational, sports, or dining facilities for the use of their members, but their primary purpose is something other than recreation.</p>
</details>
<h3>Situations</h3>
<details><summary>Situation: You provide an in-house recreational facility to your employee</summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide an in-house recreational facility, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if the facility is <strong>offered to all employees who wants the membership</strong>, whether provided free of charge or for a minimal fee.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<ul>
<li>You want to promote good health for your employees and you convert a space in your building into a fully equipped gym. Although not all employees use the gym, it is available to all employees. Since the gym qualifies as an in-house recreational facility and its available to all employees, the CRA administrative policy applies. Employees are not considered to receive a taxable benefit for the use of the gym. </li>
<li>You are the owner of a bakery who decides to provide fitness facilities to all staff at no cost. The exercise room will be located on the third floor, and will operate during regular business hours only. In this case, you are providing an in-house facility, free of charge for general use. In this situation, the CRA administrative policy applies and the benefit is not taxable. </li>
</ul>
</details>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the in-house recreational facility <strong>does not meet the condition above</strong>, the benefit is taxable.</p>
<p>To calculate the benefit, see: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p>
</details>


<details><summary>Situation: You pay on behalf of your employee the cost for an employer-owned membership to a recreational facility</summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you made an arrangement with a facility to pay a fee for the use of the facility, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and  cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Membership agreement is with the employer and not the employee </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Facility or membership is offerred to all employees who want the membership </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>You arrange with a nearby fitness club to purchase memberships at a considerable discount for use by your employees. To ensure the club is not crowded for full paying members, the club put a limit on the number of employees that can use the club at any time. The membership is held with you who issues passes daily on a first-come-first-served basis. Employees are free to purchase their own memberships at full price if they prefer to have unlimited access. However, the free passes are available to all employees who want them.</p>
<p>Since the memberships are with the employer (not the employees) and are available to all employees, the CRA administrative policy applies and the benefit is not taxable.</p>
</details>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the payment for an employer-owned membership at a recreational facility <strong>does not meet the condition above</strong>, the benefit is taxable.</p>
<p>To calculate the benefit, see: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p>
</details>


<details><summary>Situation: You pay, reimburse, or subsidize the cost for an employee-owned membership at a recreational facility to your employee</summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you pay, reimburse or subsidize the cost for an employee-owned membership to a recreational facility, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if you can <strong>clearly demonstrate you are the primary beneficiary of the membership</strong>.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary><ul>
<li>You are a clothing manufacturer that provides a gym membership to its president. The benefit is taxable because the primary beneficiary is the president and the employer receives no direct benefit. </li>
<li>You own a soccer club and you provide to all your players a membership to a gym that specializes in training for high-performance athletes. The main beneficiary is the soccer club because, if the players are able to work out, the club will perform better. The CRA administrative policy applies and the benefit is not taxable. </li>
</details>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you <strong>cannot clearly demonstrate that you are the primary beneficiary</strong>, the benefit is taxable. The membership is a taxable benefit to your employee if the membership in or use of the club's facilities provides only an indirect benefit to you. This would be the case where the employee becomes physically healthier as a result of using the club's facilities and becomes generally better able to perform their duties (for example, fewer sick days, less downtime, remain fit for duty)</p>
<p>To calculate the benefit, see: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p>
</details>

<h2 id="h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</h2>
