	<p>FMV is the highest price that can be obtained in an open market between an informed and willing buyer and an informed and willing seller who are dealing at arm's length.</p>

<p>Generally, the FMV of a benefit is the price that could be reasonably charged for the use of that benefit in an open market (that is, the market price for a similar benefit in the surrounding area). </p>

<p>This determination must be done based on a review of the facts in each specific situation.</p>
