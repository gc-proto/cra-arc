<p>Generally, the per-kilometre rates  the CRA consider reasonable are the amounts prescribed in section 7306 of the Income Tax Regulations. These rates are the <strong>maximum</strong> amount that you can deduct as business expense and can be used as a guideline to determine if an allowance paid to your employee is reasonable.</p>
