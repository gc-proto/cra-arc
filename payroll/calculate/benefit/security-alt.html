<p>You need to determine if there is an agreement between a qualifying person (corporation or a mutual trust fund) and the employee. </p>
<p>There may be a written stock option agreement, or if there is no written agreement, the terms for issuing securities, stock and trust units in the financial records of a corporation (for example, a directors' resolution in the corporate minutes or notes to financial statements) will determine the employment status of the person receiving the benefit. </p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>NAME OF EMPLOYEE</strong>, street name, City, Province, Postal code, (herein called the "Optionee")</p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>OF THE SECOND PART</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The Company has established a Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") which has been approved by the shareholders of the Company; </li>
<li>The Optionee is a director, officer, or employee of or consultant to the Company or to one of its subsidiaries; an employee of a company providing services to the Company or to one of its subsidiaries, or a company, all of the voting shares of which are owned by one of the foregoing persons; </li>

<li>The Company's shares are listed and posted for trading on The TSX XXX Exchange (the "Exchange"); </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSES THAT </strong>in consideration of the sum of $XX given by the Optionee to the Company (the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by the Company) the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Grant - </strong>The Company hereby grants the Optionee an option to purchase a total <strong>of1XX common shares </strong>in its capital (the "Option) at a price of <strong>$XX </strong>per share.

<li><strong>Exercise - </strong>In order to exercise the Option, the Optionee shall, before the Expiry Time, give notice to the Company of the Optionee's intention to exercise the Option in whole or in part, such notice to be accompanied by cash, bank draft, money order or certified cheque, payable to the Company, in the appropriate amount. Options vest and become exercisable on the following basis:

<li><strong>Hold period - </strong>In the event any portion of the Option is exercised during the first XX months following the initial grant, any shares issued on the exercise of the Options shall be subject to a hold period ending XX months from the date of grant, and shall be legended to that effect in compliance with XXX and Exchange requirements. </li>
<li><strong>Termination - </strong>If an Optionee shall:

<li><strong>Termination on Death - </strong>In the event of the death of an Optionee who is a director of the Company or any of its Designated Affiliates or who is an employee of or Consultant to the Company or any of its Designated Affiliates, or the death of an individual who is the shareholder of a Participant which is a Consultant Company where that individual has provided services to the Company or any of its Designated Affiliates (through the Participant Consultant Company), the Option theretofore granted to such Participant shall only be exercisable until the earlier of the expiry of the XXX day period next succeeding such death and the Expiry Date, and then only:

<ol>
<li>by the person or persons to whom the Participant's rights under the Option shall pass by the Participant or the Participant's shareholder's will or the laws of descent and distribution; and </li>
<li>to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of his or her death. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Option granted is personal to the Optionee and may not be assigned or transferred in whole or in part.    </li>
<li>This Agreement and the Option shall in all respects be governed by the provisions of the Company's Plan, a copy of which is attached to this Agreement as Schedule "A". Definitions used in the Plan apply herein. The Optionee hereby acknowledges that the Optionee has read and accepts the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Plan. </li>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">The <strong>agreement is made between the qualifying person (corporation or a mutual trust fund)</strong> and one of the following:</p>
<details><summary>Agreement: <strong>Person ceased to be an employee</strong> [7(4)]</summary>
<h4 id="step1b">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and the person ceased to be an employee, the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong>. </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>If a person was an employee at the time of receiving a right to acquire shares, but subsequently ceases to be an employee (for example, change jobs or retire) before the exercise or transfer of that right, the person is treated as an employee until the transaction is completed. The benefit is included in their employment income and the person is deemed to have received the benefit as if they are still employed.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>A person had the option to purchase 10,000 shares of ABC Inc. when the employment began. On November 30, 2020, the person employment ceased when they resigned from his position as Manager.
A clause in the stock option agreement allowed the person to purchase these shares within a period of 90 calendar days after the date of termination.
On January 20, 2021, the person chose to purchase 20,000 shares at the price of $.50 cents per share.</p>
<p>Although the person's employment ceased on November 30, 2020, any benefit from the purchase of shares in ABC Inc. on January 20, 2021 is considered taxable under 7(1). </p>
</details>
</details>

<details><summary>Agreement: Employee is a <strong>shareholder</strong> [7(5)]</summary>
<h4 id="step1c">Not by virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person who is a shareholder, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>considered received by virtue of employment if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Benefit is a distribution of profits </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Similar benefits are not available to employees who were not shareholders </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Duties of other employees <strong>not </strong>equally important </li>
</ul>
<h4>Factors to consider</h4>
<p>Under 7(5), section 7 <strong>does not</strong> apply if "the benefit conferred by the agreement was not received in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of, the employment".</p>
<p>If the employee is also a shareholder, it is a question of fact whether the individual received the shares in their capacity as a shareholder <strong>or </strong>an employee. Section 7 does not apply when the benefit conferred by the stock option agreement was not received by reason of the <strong>individual's employment</strong>.</p>
<p>If an individuals' or a group of individuals' shareholding are sufficiently large so as to enable them to be in a position to control the company's actions, it is questionable whether the benefit was received "<strong>by virtue of employment</strong>".</p>
<p>You need to determine if the benefit resulted from the individual's role as an employee or their role as a shareholder. In addition to control, other factors must be considered.</p>

<p>The person was not an employee of the junior public mining corporation. Section 7 does not apply because the benefit was not received "in respect of", "in the course of", or "by virtue of", employment.</p>

<h4 id="step1e">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and a non-resident employer, the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong>. </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>Under section 7, where a non-resident corporation (whether public or private) agrees to sell or issue shares (either of itself or of another corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length) to individuals either:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employed by it in Canada </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employed in Canada by a corporation with which the non-resident corporation does not deal at arm's length </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, where the foreign parent of a Canadian subsidiary agrees to sell or issue shares of the parent corporation to employees of the subsidiary.</p>
<details><summary>Factors to consider</summary>
<p>You need to confirm if foreign plan conforms to Canadian tax rules in order to determine if sections 7 and if the employee is eligible for the deduction under 110(1)(d). </p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>On March 7, an employee is granted 100 options to purchase shares of their employer's parent corporation at the FMV of $10 US ($1 US = $1.35 CDN). </p>
<p>On September 2 the employee informs their employer that they wish to exercise their 100 options and pays the employer $1000 US ($1 US = $1.25 CDN). The exercise price is $10 US and the FMV is $20 US on this date. </p>
<p>On September 5 the treasury shares are transferred to the employee at a FMV of $19 US ($1 US = $1.20 CDN). </p>

<details><summary>Agreement: <strong>Trustee as an intermediary</strong></summary>
<h4 id="step1f">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and a trustee as an intermediary, the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong>.</p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>When the employer uses a trust as an intermediary to sell or issue its shares held in a corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length, the employee is still considered to be dealing with the employer per section 7(2) of the ITA. Where the trustee holds the securities for an employee, acquisitions and dispositions of the securities by the trustee are treated as acquisitions and dispositions by the employee for the purposes of section 7 and paragraphs 110(1)(d), 110(1)(d.1) and (d.01) of the Act.</p>
<p>Where the employee exercises a security option and the agreement provides for the shares to be held in trust, but the employee does not meet the conditions of the agreement and the shares are forfeited back to the issuing corporation, there is no change to the taxable benefit reported on the T4. However, the employee may become eligible for a deduction under subsection 8(12) of the Income Tax Act. When the individual is eligible, this deduction may be claimed when filing the T1, and is equal to the value of the stock option benefit previously received (less 50% if the individual has previously claimed the stock option deduction for the benefit).</p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>Ashley is granted 10,000 options on March 4, 2014, when the FMV of each share is $20. Ashley must be an employee for at least three years after date of exercise before the shares are fully vested, or the employer may buy back the shares for $0.01 each. Ashley exercises her option on May 1, 2015, when the FMV of each share is $25. In 2015, Ashley's benefit is equal to $50,000 [10,000 x (25-20)], and this amount is reported on her T4.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2016, Ashley leaves the company, and as a result, forfeits her securities, and receives $100 in consideration for the $50,000 of shares. There are no changes to Ashley's T4 for 2014, 2015, or 2016, but when Ashley files her tax return, she may, in the year in which she forfeited the securities, claim a deduction of $50,000 from her income.</p>

<details><summary>Agreement: <strong>No stock</strong> option agreement</summary>
<h4>By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If there is no stock option agreement, the amount paid to the employee is considered received by <strong> virtue of employment</strong> .</p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>A stock option agreement is understood as an agreement to sell or issue shares of the capital stock of an employer corporation or of a corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length.  </p>
<p>Where there is no agreement to sell or issue shares, the benefit will not be taxable under section 7, but will generally be taxable under either section 5 or 6(1)(a), by virtue of employment.</p>

</ul>
</li>

<li><h3 id="step2">Determine if the benefit is taxable</h3>
<p>The benefit is taxable when <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee acquires, purchases or receives the securities at less than the FMV </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee sells, transfers, or disposes of options rights for a financial gain </li>
</ul>

<h4>Events that cause the employee benefit</h4>

<details><summary>Event: Employee chooses to <strong>exercises their rights </strong>and <strong>acquires the shares </strong>[7(1)(a)]</summary>
<p id="event1">This applies when the employee chooses to exercise their rights under the agreement and acquire the securities. An acquisition is considered to take place when:</p>
<ul>
<li>title to the shares passes to the employee </li>
<li>the employer has legal right to payment for the shares </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the employee notifies the employer that they wishes to exercise their options to acquire shares.</p>

<details><summary> Security option is exercised for preferred shares and a share is acquired, including shares convertible to common shares</summary>
<p>Where an employee acquires convertible preferred shares, they are taxable as employee benefits because the benefits are considered to be received by virtue of employment under 7(1)(a) of the ITA.  </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>Convertible preferred shares are preferred shares of a corporation that are convertible to common shares of the corporation. Convertible preferred shares include forward participating shares. Forward participating shares are generally those shares of a separate class of a corporation that are purchased by the individual for fair market value consideration. The forward participating shares derive most of their value from their convertibility into common shares of the corporation.</p>
<p>Pursuant to an agreement between an employee and the employer corporation, or a corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length, the initial acquisition of preferred shares to which a conversion feature is attached is no different than the acquisition of any other shares of the capital stock of the corporation.</p>
<p>Paragraph 7(1)(a) deems a benefit equal to the difference between the value of the shares at the date of acquisition and the amount paid or to be paid for the shares to have been received by the employee in the taxation year in which the shares are acquired. In the case of a CCPC, the benefit is deferred until the employee disposes of the acquired share.</p>
<p>The value of the shares at the date of acquisition may not be readily determinable because of the necessity to assign a value to the conversion feature, or to allow a discount for any restrictions that the conversion feature may impose.</p>
</details>

<details><summary> Security option is exercised, a share is acquired and sold on before the share is received by the employee (short selling) </summary>
<p>Short selling transactions are taxable as employee benefits because the benefits are considered to be received by virtue of employment under 7(1)(a) of the ITA.  </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>The concept of short selling can be best illustrated with the following example. An employee exercises a stock option and at the same time instructs their broker to sell the shares on the market immediately. The actual transactions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The employee notifies the corporation in writing June 30, 2018, that they wish to exercise the stock options. </li>
<li>On the same notification that the employee sends to the corporation, the employee authorizes their broker to sell the shares obtained upon the exercise of the options and to pay the corporation the exercise price for the shares. </li>
<li>The broker immediately sells shares of the corporation on the open market (June 30). This, however, is a so-called "short sale" because the corporation has not, and will not, actually issue shares from treasury to the broker (the agent of the employee) until it is paid the exercise price by the broker. </li>
<li>The broker sells the shares on the trade date (June 30), obtains cash, and then, generally, a few days later, pays the corporation the exercise price on the employee's behalf. On July 3, 2018, the employee receives the treasury shares from the corporation (this covers the broker's position in respect of the shares that it sold "short" a few days earlier). </li>
</ul>
<p>July 3rd is the date the shares are "acquired" for purposes of calculating the taxable benefit.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Situation: Employee acquires shares from a <strong>non-CCPC</strong> employer</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the employee acquires shares under a security options agreement entered into by a non-CCPC, the benefit is taxable.</p>

<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>in the year in which the employee acquires the shares</strong>under 7(1)(a).</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Employee acquires shares from a <strong>CCPC</strong>,  including employers who was a CCPC at the time the security option agreement was entered into and subsequently ceased to be one</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>

<p>If the employee acquires shares under a security options agreement entered into by a CCPC, the benefit is taxable.</p>

<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>in the year in which the employee disposes of the shares</strong> under 7(1.1).</p>

<details><summary>Event: Employee <strong>transfers or disposes of rights </strong>to a person with whom the employee was <strong>dealing at arm's length </strong>[7(1)(b)] or to the particular <strong>qualifying person </strong>with whom the employee was <strong>not dealing at arm's length </strong>[7(1)(b.1)], including security option cash outs</summary>
<p id="event2">This applies in <strong>one </strong>of the following situations:</p>

<li>There is a significant change in the terms of the security option agreement that resulted in a disposition of the option </li>
<li>The employee has disposed of security option rights to a third party as part of a transaction that results in an ownership change in the corporation </li>
<li>The employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. This is often referred to as "cash out". </li>
</ul>
<p>This also applies when the employee is deemed to have received a benefit when they dispose of rights under a security option agreement to an employer with which the employee does not deal at arm's length (or to a person not dealing at arm's length with such an employer), including cash outs.</p>
<details><summary>Situation: Employee <strong>disposes</strong> of their rights under the security option agreement and the <strong>employer </strong>elects to cash out the rights</summary>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee <strong>chooses </strong>to receive shares in lieu of a cash bonus already declared by the employer </li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>on the date the security option was cashed out </strong>under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). This is because the employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. The security option cash out <strong>cannot </strong>be deferred.</p>
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<ul>
<li>An employer offers an annual bonus when key corporate objectives have been met.  Although the employee doesn't know whether the objectives will be met this year, the employee advised their employer that, if he is entitled to a bonus, he wants to take shares of the corporation instead of receiving a cash bonus.  Section 7 will apply in this situation. </li>
<li>If the employee waits until the bonus is declared and then opts to take shares instead of the cash payment, the value of the shares the employee receives will be taxed as employment income under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). Section 7 would not apply in this situation. </li>
</ul>
