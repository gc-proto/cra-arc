<details><summary>Situation: Loans or debts that are forgiven </summary>
<div id="ajax-forgivable">
<h4>In general</h4>
<p>Forgivable loans are types of loans that allow borrowers to have the balance of the loan partially or totally forgiven if they meet certain conditions.</p>
<p>The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you forgive your employee's loan or debt. The amount forgiven is <strong>always</strong> taxable. </p>
<h4>Specific to shareholdings</h4>
<p>Forgivable loans received because of shareholdings and a subsequent forgiveness is not considered to be employment income even though the shareholder is also an employee at the time it was forgiven. Instead the forgiven amount is considered as income received by the person in their capacity as a shareholder. </p>
<p> Forgiven shareholder loans are taxable as income to the shareholder. Where a person is both a shareholder and an employee, it would be a question of fact whether the indebtedness arose as a result of the person's shareholdings or as a result of the office or employment.</p>
<h4>Specific to pursuing education or research</h4>
<p>If you provide an employee with a forgivable loan to enable them to pursue education or research on condition that they return to employment with you, the income is not to be included in their taxable income at the time they receive it. When the loan (or part of the loan) is later forgiven for the reason that the employment conditions were met, the forgiven part would be included as employment income in the year it was forgiven.</p>
<div class="well brdr-rds-0"><p>Forgivable loans do not include scholarships, fellowships, bursaries or research grants.</p>
<p>For the forgivable loan policy to apply, the amount must be a bone fide loan, repayable if certain conditions are not met.</p>

<h4>When to include the benefit on the T4 or T4A slip</h4>
<p>The loan does not need to be outstanding at the borrower's tax year-end for a benefit to be calculated. </p>
<details><summary>If the employee makes a payment during the period</summary>
<p>If the employee makes a payment during the period then two separate calculations are required for the period. Each calculation is based on the declining balance of the loan as payments are made.</p></details>
<details><summary>If the loan is partially or fully forgiven</summary>
<p>If the loan is partially or fully forgiven, the amount forgiven is employment income in the hands of the employee <strong>in the year the loan is forgiven</strong>. There may also be an interest benefit in prior years and up to the date the loan is forgiven.</p></details>
<details><summary>If the loan is considered a repayable award</summary>
<p>If the loan is considered a repayable award, the amount is employment income and must be included on the slip <strong>in the year received</strong>.</p></details>
<h4>What to do with combined loans with low-interest and higher prescribed interest rates</h4>
<p>If you provide two loans to your employee, one at low interest and the other at a rate higher than the prescribed interest rate, combine the loans to calculate the benefit.</p>

<details><summary>Calculation: Home purchase loans or home relocation loans</summary>
<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-bttm mrgn-tp-md"><dt>Home purchase loan</dt>
<dd>A home-purchase loan is any part of a loan to an employee that the employee used to get or repay another loan to buy a residence. The residence has to be for that employee or a person related to that employee. This also applies to a shareholder or a person related to a shareholder.</dd>

<dt>Home relocation loan</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only a debt that is a loan can be a home relocation loan. A home-relocation loan is a loan you give to an employee or an employee's spouse or common-law partner when they meet <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee or your employee's spouse or common-law partner moves to start work at a new location in Canada</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Your employee or your employee's spouse or common-law partner uses the loan to buy a new residence that is at least 40 kilometres closer to the new work location than the previous home</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Your employee or your employee's spouse or common-law partner receives the loan because of the employee's employment</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Your employee designates the loan as a home-relocation loan</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> The loan is used to acquire a residence or a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation acquired only to obtain the right to inhabit a residence owned by the corporation. The residence must be for the habitation of the employee and be their new residence</li>
</ul>
</dd></dl>
<p>Once you determined the benefit is considered a home purchase loan or a home relocation loan, the interest benefit is calculated in the same manner as <a href="#emp" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">loans received because of employment (previous, current, or future)&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Exception:</strong> The amount of interest calculated as a taxable benefit should not be more than the interest that would have been charged at the prescribed rate in effect when the employee made the loan or incurred the debt</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> If it is a home purchase loan, the prescribed rate is set as a ceiling at the time the loan is granted, but may decrease if the prevailing prescribed rate falls</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> If the term of repayment for the loan is more than five years, the balance owing at the end of five years (from the day the loan was made) is considered a new loan. Treat the outstanding balance as a new loan on that date.</li></ul>
 
		 <details>
			 <summary>Examples: Home purchase loans or home relocation loans</summary>
<ul>			
<li>January 1, 20X1, an employee borrows $100,000 from their employer.</li>
<li>Loan is repayable in 25 years. The term is 3 years with an interest rate of 2%.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">Prescribed interest rates</a> for 20X1 is 3%, 20X2 is 4% and 20X3 1%.</li>
<li>Employee made interest payments of $1,000 in 20X1, $2,000 in 20X2 and $1,500 in 20X3.</li>
<li>Employee made a payment on principal balance of $10,000 on January 1, 20X3.</li>
<li>January 1, 20X4, the loan is renewed for another three year term with an interest rate of 2%. </li>
<li>Prescribed interest rates for 20X4 is 3%, 20X5 is 4% and 20X6 4%.</li>
<li>Employee made interest payments of $1,500 in 20X4, $1,500 in 20X5 and $1,500 in 20X6.</li>
<li>Employee made payments on principal balance of $10,000 on January 1, 20X4, $10,000 on January 1, 20X4 and $20,000 on January 1, 20X6.</li></ul>
<p> For the example below, each year is being calculated with a single prescribed interest rate for simplicity. Actual calculations would be done quarterly with the quarterly rates, which can change quarter by quarter.</p>
