<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Content published on December 13, 2024 to include the <strong>proposed changes to the security options deduction</strong> which were to take effect <strong>June 25, 2024</strong> has been updated. The proposed change has been postponed to January 1, 2026 and it is identified with the tag <span class="label label-warning">Under proposed legislation</span>.</p>
<details><summary>What are the changes</summary>
<p><strong>Under the proposed legislation</strong>, the security options deductions under paragraphs 110(1)(d) and 110(1)(d.1) of the Income Tax Act (<abbr title="Income Tax Act">ITA</abbr>) will be reduced to 1/3.</p>
<p>As a result of this proposed change, the T4 slip was adjusted for the 2024 calendar year.</p>
<p>For administrative simplicity, the 2024 T4 slip will not be changed again as a result of the changes to the proposed legislation being postponed.</p>
<p>To reduce the burden on employers and payroll service providers, a new CRA administrative policy was introduced for T4 reporting of security options benefits and deductions from June 25, 2024 to December 31, 2024.</p>

<details><summary>Types of agreements to issue securities</summary>
<p>The following are types of plans through which the employer sells or issues securities or security options to employees:</p>
<h4>Stock options plan</h4>
<p>Under this type of plan, an employer grants the employee the option to purchase a specified number of securities, at a pre-determined price within a specified period. </p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>During the vesting period, the options partially vest over a five year period. Each year, 20% of the total options become  <a href="#def-vested" aria-controls="def-vested" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">vested&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>, and can be exercised, sold or transferred.</p>
<p>This type of plan may be an incentive for the employee to remain with the employer.</p>
</details>

<h4>Employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)</h4>
<p>Under this type of plan, an employer grants the employee the option to acquire shares at a discounted price (an amount that is less than the value of the stock at the time the shares were acquired). Many <abbr title="Employee stock purchase plan">ESPP</abbr>s allow an employee to contribute a certain amount over a period of time and, for specified periods, the employee can purchase shares at a discount using the accumulated contributions.</p>

<h4>Stock bonus plan</h4>
<p>Under this type of plan, the employer agrees to give the securities at no cost to the employee. </p>

<h4>Restricted stock plan or restricted stock units (RSU)</h4>
<ul>
<li>An employer can agree to issue or sell securities to their employees. The employees <a href="#def-acquisition" aria-controls="def-acquisition" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">acquire&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> securities subject to certain conditions (such as restriction from selling) during a vesting period, after which they are given full rights. </li>
<li>The differences between <abbr title="Restricted stock plan or restricted stock units">RSU</abbr>s and standard stock options plans are:

<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p>If a person was your employee at the time of receiving a right to acquire shares, but subsequently ceases to be your employee (for example, changes jobs or retires) before the  <a href="#def-exercise" aria-controls="def-exercise" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">exercise <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> or transfer of that right, the person is treated as your employee until the transaction is completed. This time period will depend on the terms of the security option agreement and how long the employee retains an option to acquire securities after their employment ceases. The benefit is included in their employment income and the person is deemed to have received the benefit as if they were still employed.</p>

<details><summary>Example - Former employee</summary>
<h5>Description</h5>
<ul>
<li>An employee was granted an option under a security option agreement to purchase 20,000 shares of ABC Inc during the course of their employment. </li>
<li>On November 30, 2020, the employee’s employment ceased when they resigned from their position as Manager.  </li>
<li>A clause in the security option agreement allowed the person to purchase the shares within a period of 90 calendar days after the date of termination. </li>
<li>On January 20, 2021, the person chose to purchase 20,000 shares at the price of $0.50 cents per share. </li></ul>
<h5>Result</h5>
<p>Although the person's employment ceased on November 30, 2020, the benefit from the purchase of shares in ABC Inc. on January 20, 2021 is considered to have been received because of an <strong>employment relationship</strong> and is taxable under subsection 7(4). </p>

<details><summary>Example - Not considered received because of an employment relationship</summary>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Similar benefits are not available to employees who were not shareholders</li>

<ul>
<li>A person is president of ABC Inc. </li>
<li>They own 51% of that corporation's common voting shares. </li>
<li>The person's spouse owns 10%. </li>
<li>The person and their spouse are the only people who concluded a security option agreement with ABC Inc. </li>
<li>The security option agreements were not offered to any other employee. </li></ul>
<h5>Result</h5>
<p>The person is in a position of control. The person and the spouse receive the benefit because of the person’s capacity as a shareholder.  </p>
<p>The benefit received from exercising the option is <strong>not</strong> taxable as an employee benefit because it is <strong>not</strong> considered to be received because of an employment relationship.</p>
<p> However, the benefit is still taxable as a shareholder benefit.</p>
<p>If your employee is also a shareholder, it is a <strong>question of fact</strong> whether the individual received the shares in their capacity as a shareholder <strong>or</strong> as your employee. </p>
