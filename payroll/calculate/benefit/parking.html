<h2 id="h_1">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h2>
<p> Generally, parking you provide or reimburse to your employees is a taxable benefit. This includes situations where you provide parking to your employee at a cost that is less than the fair market value (FMV) of the parking space.</p>

<div id="ajax-fmv">
<p>	FMV is the highest price that can be obtained in an open market between an informed and willing buyer and an informed and willing seller who are dealing at arm's length.</p>
	<p>Generally, the FMV of a parking spot is the price that could be reasonably charged for the use of that spot in an open market (that is, the market price for a similar spot in the surrounding area). Normally, the cost to the employer is not a factor in determining the value of the benefit. For example, where the employer owns the lot, the value would be based on the FMV, not the employer's cost.</p>
	</div>


 <p>Depending on your situation, the <a href="what.html#h_4">CRA's administrative policy</a> makes an exemption for parking you provide or reimburse. If the CRA's administrative policy applies, the benefit is not taxable. </p>

<p>

<h3>Employee uses the vehicle regularly for business purposes - Average of 3 or more days out of 5 work days</h3>
<p> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide or reimburse an employee for parking for business purposes, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable where the employee regularly has to use a vehicle to perform their duties of employment. The CRA considers "regularly" to be an average of at least 3 days in a 5 day work week.</p>
<p>If the employee needs the use of the a vehicle for business purposes less frequently, the CRA will accept a proration of the benefit. For example, if the employee uses a vehicle in the course of their duties an average of 1 day in a 5 day work week, the value of the parking benefit may be reduced by 20%, which represents 1 day of business use out of a 5 day work week.</p>

<details><summary>Parking you provide to an employee at a shopping centre or industrial park </summary>

<p> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide parking at a shopping centre or industrial park, the benefit is <strong>not taxable if all of the following apply</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and  cnjnctn-md">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">parking lot open to both employees and the public </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">parking spaces are available free of charge </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">parking spaces are not assigned to employees </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>A supermarket operates out of a mall. The mall has a large parking lot which is available for use by both employees and customers. The supermarket's lease with the mall includes a right to use the parking lot. Although the right to use a parking space is considered a benefit to the employee, the employer is not required to include an amount on their T4. </p>
</details></details>
	      
<details><summary>Parking where you provide a limited number of parking spaces <span class="label label-warning">New CRA administrative policy</span></summary>
<p> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide parking with a limited number of parking spaces, the benefit is <strong>not taxable if all of the following apply</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and  cnjnctn-md">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
   <strong>not more </strong>than 2 parking spaces available for every 3 employees who want parking (scramble parking)
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    parking spaces are not assigned (random or uncertain)
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    parking spaces are offered to all employees who want parking
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The ratio is based on the average of parking spaces that the employer can reasonably expect to be needed on a regular basis. For example, if over the course of the year, the employer reasonably expects there are 3 employees wanting parking for every 2 available parking spaces on most days, we would view the available parking to be insufficient for that year. The calculation should be made on an annual basis or sooner, if there is a significant change to the ratio. </p>
<p> Since the employee's access to parking is random and uncertain, it is difficult for the employer to accurately assign a value to the benefit enjoyed by any particular employee and no taxable benefit will be required to be calculated.  </p>
