<li> <h3 id="steps">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h3>
<p> Generally, parking you provide or reimburse to your employees is a taxable benefit. This includes situations where you provide parking to your employee at a cost that is less than the fair market value (FMV) of the parking space.</p>
<details class="mrgn-bttm-md"><summary>What is the fair market value (FMV) of the parking space <span class="label label-info">Update - Clarification</span></summary>
<div id="ajax-fmv">
<h4>Definition of FMV</h4>
<p>FMV is the highest price that can be obtained in an open market between an informed and willing buyer and an informed and willing seller who are dealing at arm's length.</p>

<h4>FMV for a parking benefit </h4>
<p>Generally, the FMV for a parking spot refers to the price that could reasonably be charged in the open market for a similar spot in the surrounding area. In most cases, the cost to the employer is not a factor in determining the FMV.</p>

<p>Examples of how this applies include:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">
<h5>Lot owned by the employer</h5>
 <p>Where the employer owns the lot, the value would be based on the FMV, not the employer's cost. </p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">
<h5>Employer leases or rents parking</h5>
<p>Where the parking space provided is charged for as part of an employer’s lease or rental agreement, the FMV will be the amount charged to the employer for the parking space as long as the amount reflects the rate charged to the public for a similar space.</p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">
<h5>Any other case</h5>
<p>The FMV of the parking benefit must be determined by the employer regardless of whether any actual cost is incurred by the employer or the employees for the parking.</p>
</li></ul>
<h4>Availability of the benefit  </h4>
<p>The benefit the employer reports also needs to reflect the availability of the parking provided to the employee. For example, where an employee is provided with a monthly parking benefit, the FMV reflects that an employee usually does not work 30 days in a month but still has the <strong>right</strong> to park in the lot each day.</p>

<h4>Methods for determining the FMV </h4>
<p>The CRA does not prescribe a specific method to determine FMV. This determination must be done based on a review of the facts in each specific situation.  </p>
<p>Employers can:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Follow fundamental appraisal principles</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Use a direct comparison approach</li>
</ul>
<h5>Research suggestions from CRA</h5>
<p>The CRA suggests you research the value of the parking based on: </p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The rates charged to the public for a similar parking space in the same area as the parking being provided to your employee</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The same conditions of use as the parking being provided to your employee (for example, where nearby lots offer daily and monthly rates, if you provide monthly parking benefits, the monthly rates should be reviewed) </li>
</ul>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>An employer provides parking spaces for all of their employees on a daily basis at no cost to the employee in an uncovered lot reserved for their employees in a busy downtown neighbourhood. There are sufficient parking spaces for all employees to find parking on each weekday they are required to report to the office.</p>
<p>The employer researched the FMV by reviewing publicly available parking rates in the immediate neighbourhood.  </p>
<p>The employer found that: </p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> The average cost for parking across the city is $18 per day on weekdays </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> In the immediate neighbourhood, parking spaces in comparable uncovered lots cost an average of $22 per day </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> There are also covered lots nearby which average $26 per day </li>
</ul>

<p>As the comparable parking spaces to those provided to their employees in the immediate area average $22 per day, $22 would be considered the FMV of the parking space per day, unless there was some other factor in how the parking was provided that either increases or decreases the FMV. </p>
</ul>

<h4>When to re-evaluate the FMV</h4>
<p>Generally, you should re-evaluate the FMV of the parking benefit when there is a significant change to the market for parking in the area that may impact the FMV.</p>

		</div>
</details>
<p>Depending on your situation, the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> makes an exemption for parking you provide or reimburse. If the CRA's administrative policy applies, the benefit is not taxable. </p>		 

<h3>Situations</h3>
 
<details><summary>Situation: Parking you provide or reimburse to an employee for business purposes </summary>
<p>Parking is provided for business purposes where the employee is regularly required to use a vehicle in the performance of their job, such as travelling off-site to meetings or service calls. Travel between work and home is <strong>not </strong>considered travel for business purposes.</p>
<details><summary>Examples: Business purposes versus not for business purposes</summary>

<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger  fa-li"></span> Parking where the employee drove to work but used another means of transportation for off-site business activities (for example, walking or taking a taxi to a meeting at the office of a business client) </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li "></span> Using a vehicle only to establish the regular use for business purposes criteria (for example, driving to a meeting across the street, or to a meeting where the employee would generally carpool or take a taxi) </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
	
</details>



	
<h3>Employee uses the vehicle regularly for business purposes - Average of 3 or more days out of 5 work days</h3>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide or reimburse an employee for parking for business purposes, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable where the employee regularly has to use a vehicle to perform their duties of employment. The CRA considers "regularly" to be an average of at least 3 days in a 5 day work week.</p>
<h4>Taxable and partially taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the employee needs the use of a vehicle for business purposes less frequently, the CRA will accept a proration of the benefit. For example, if the employee uses a vehicle in the course of their duties an average of 1 day in a 5 day work week, the value of the parking benefit may be reduced by 20%, which represents 1 day of business use out of a 5 day work week.</p>

<p>To calculate the benefit, refer to: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p> 
</details>
<details><summary>Situation: Parking you provide to an employee at a shopping centre or industrial park </summary>

<p> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide parking at a shopping centre or industrial park, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and  cnjnctn-md">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">Parking lot is open to both employees and the public </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Parking spaces are available free of charge </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Parking spaces are not assigned to employees </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>A supermarket operates out of a mall. The mall has a large parking lot which is available for use by both employees and customers. The supermarket's lease with the mall includes a right to use the parking lot. Although the right to use a parking space is considered a benefit to the employee, the employer is not required to include an amount on their T4. </p>

<p> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide parking with a limited number of parking spaces, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if all of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and  cnjnctn-md">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
   <strong>Not more </strong>than 2 parking spaces available for every 3 employees who want parking (scramble parking)
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    Parking spaces are not assigned (random or uncertain)
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    Parking spaces are offered to all employees who want parking
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The ratio is based on the average of parking spaces that the employer can reasonably expect to be needed on a regular basis. For example, if over the course of the year, the employer reasonably expects there are 3 employees wanting parking for every 2 available parking spaces on most days, we would view the available parking to be insufficient for that year. The calculation should be made on an annual basis or sooner, if there is a significant change to the ratio. </p>
<p> Since the employee's access to parking is random and uncertain, it may be difficult and excessively burdensome for the employer to determine the benefit enjoyed by any particular employee. In this situation, no taxable benefit will be required to be included in income.  </p>

<p>If your employee has a disability, the parking benefit is generally not taxable. </p>

<details><summary>Situation:  Parking you provide or reimburse to an employee because of the closure of the place of employment for the period of March 15, 2020 to December 31, 2022</summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p><span class="label label-danger">CRA temporary administrative policy</span> Under the CRA's <strong>temporary</strong> administrative policy, if you provide or reimburse an employee for parking for the period of March 15, 2020 to December 31, 2022, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">COVID-19 caused a closure of the place of employment during the period, including situations where:
<ul>
<li>the employees were sent home by the employer </li>
<li>they were given the option to work from home on a full-time basis due to the pandemic </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col-50">parking benefit relates to the period when the place of employment was closed</li>
</ul>
 <h4>Taxable situation</h4>
			 
<p>Once an employee returns to their regular place of employment to perform their duties, including situations where an employee regularly returns to their regular place of work to perform their employment duties on a part time basis, the policy no longer applies. This means it is taxable as an employee benefit </p>
