<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Educational assistance</h1>

 <div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Content has been updated for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the current CRA administrative policy. </strong></p>

</div>

<p>You may provide educational assistance to your employee, a former employee or an employee's family member. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>Reimbursement or payment of tuition and training fees </li>
<li>Scholarships and bursaries </li>
<li>Subsidized school services </li>
<li>Educational allowances </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>It important to make the difference between scholarships and bursaries, and a research grant.</p> 
<details><summary>What is a scholarship</summary>
<p>Scholarships are amounts awarded to students, or on their behalf, to enable them to pursue their education. They can include amounts paid to defray living expenses, as well as amounts that are directly related to tuition fees. They usually apply to studies at the postsecondary level or beyond, intended to obtain a university degree, a diploma or a certificate. However, there are circumstances under which scholarships are awarded for education below the postsecondary school level. Normally, a student is not expected to do specific work for the payer in exchange for a scholarship or bursary.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>What is a bursary</summary>
<p>Bursaries are similar to scholarships in the sense that they are amounts or benefits awarded to individuals to enable them to pursue their education. However, the recipient is usually a graduate student and the payer is a university, charity or similar organization. In general, bursaries are awarded for doctoral studies or postdoctoral work.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>What is a research grant</summary>
<p>Research Grants are a sum of money provided to an individual for the payment of expenses necessary to conduct a research project. The grant may include personal or living expenses. The grant may also include an element of remuneration to the recipient.  Funds originating from various sources may be paid to and administered by a college, university, hospital, or similar institution where the researcher is employed. However, only that part of the grant paid to, or otherwise available for, the researcher is considered to be a research grant.</p>

<h2 id="h_1">Determine if the benefit is taxable</h2>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-lg">Generally, if you pay, reimburse or provide an allowance for educational expenses to your employee, a former employee or an employee's family member, the benefit is taxable.  Depending on your situation, the benefit may not be taxable under the Income Tax Act or the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. </p>

<h3>Situations</h3>
<details><summary>Situation: You provide or reimburse for <strong>tuition and training</strong> fees to your <strong>current or former employee</strong></summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the Income Tax Act, if you provide or reimburse for a course, a program, or training to your current or former employee, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following applies:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Training is <a href="#specific">specific or general employment-related</a></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee returns to work for you for a reasonable amount of time (you must be able to justify your position regarding the length of the period of time being reasonable) </li>

</ul>
<p>You must be able to <strong>clearly demonstrate you are the primary beneficiary of the expense</strong>.</p>
<details><summary>What is a specific employment-related, general employment-related or personal interest training</summary>
<p id="specific">The CRA considered following 3 categories of training:  </p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Specific employment-related training   </h5> 
<p>Training taken to maintain or upgrade employment-related skills are mainly for the employer's benefit when it is reasonable to assume that the employee will resume their employment for a reasonable period of time after they finish the course.</p>
<p>Tuition fees and other associated costs such as books, meals, travel, and accommodation that employers pay for courses leading to a degree, diploma, or certificate in a field related to the employee's current or future responsibilities in the employer's business.</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <h5>General employment-related training   </h5> 
<p>Training for general employment-related, even if not directly related to an employer's business, are taken mainly for the employer's benefit.</p>
<p>For example, fees the employer pays for stress management, employment equity, first aid, and language courses.</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <h5>Personal interest training   </h5> 
<p>Training for personal interest or technical skills not related to the employer's business are taken mainly for the employee's benefit. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Your employee <strong>cannot claim </strong>the non-refundable tuition tax credit, or the educational amount, on their T1 return.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: You provide or reimburse for <strong>tuition and training</strong> fees to your <strong>future employee</strong></summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you provide or reimburse for a course, a program, or training to your future employee, this is <strong>not </strong>taxable as an employee benefit because there is no employee/employer relationship between the payer and the future employee (student).</p>
<p>The individual must report the amounts received on their T1 return.</p>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>A student may receive educational assistance in exchange for which they agree to work at the end of their studies or training for the person granting the financial assistance. </p>
<h5>Report on T4A slip</h5>
<p>The payer must report the full amount of the educational assistance paid on a T4A slip. If they meet certain criteria, the individual may claim the non-refundable tuition tax credit or the educational amount, on their T1 return. </p>
