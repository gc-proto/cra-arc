<p><img src="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/images/flag-qc.png" alt=""> Content has been updated to include a <strong>new CRA temporary administrative policy</strong> on whether a medical insurance plan meets the “all or substantially all” condition to be considered a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> in Quebec. This temporary policy is <strong>effective January 1, 2025</strong>, until further notice, and is identified with the tag <span class="label label-warning">New CRA temporary administrative policy.</span></p>
</div>
<details><summary>What are the changes to the Quebec legislation</summary>
<div id="ajax-phsp-info2">
<p>When the changes to the <strong>Quebec legislation made by Bill 68 come into effect</strong>, an insurer or employer benefit plan administrator <strong>will not be able to</strong> request a prescription for specific medical expenses. </p>
<p>Under this temporary policy, if requesting a prescription for the expense is prohibited by these changes, the CRA will consider the expense to be eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> if <strong>all other conditions</strong> for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> are met for this expense. </p>
<p>This <strong>only applies</strong> for the purpose of determining if this condition of being a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> is met for <strong>insurance plans in the province of Quebec</strong>.</p>
</div></details>
</div>

<p>Generally, if you pay directly or reimburse your employee for medical examinations or medical expenses, the payment is a taxable benefit. However, medical expenses paid under the terms of a private health services plan (PHSP) will not be taxable.</p>

<li><h3 id="step2">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h3>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-lg">Generally, if you pay directly or reimburse your employee for medical examinations and medical expenses, these amounts are taxable. Depending on your situation, the benefit may not be taxable. </p>

<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>The benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5 class="text-muted h4">Medical examination</h5> 
<p>You pay directly or reimburse your employee for a <strong>medical examination</strong> that was <strong>required</strong> for your employee to meet a <strong>condition of employment</strong>. The medical examination is considered to be primarily for your benefit.</p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>An employer reimburses an employee for a medical examination required as a condition of employment.  As the  exam is primarily for the benefit of the employer, the amount reimbursed by the employer would not be a taxable benefit to the employee.  </p>
</details>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5 class="text-muted h4" id="med-phsp">Medical expenses</h5>
<p>Your employee’s <strong>medical expenses</strong> were paid under a <strong>private health services plan (PHSP)</strong>.</p>

<div id="ajax-phsp-def">
<p>A plan is considered a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> where <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">

</ul>
<details><summary>Example - <strong>Connected expenses</strong></summary>
<p>The employee group medical insurance plan for Company ABC covers the cost of transporting an employee and their vehicle home if that employee becomes ill while out of Canada. That employee must return to Canada for medical treatment but cannot drive because of their illness.</p>
<p>In this situation, the cost of transporting the vehicle to the employee’s home is not a medical expense. However, as long as it is incurred within a reasonable time after the medical expense, it is considered a connected expense because the employee could not drive back to Canada to get medical treatment (which is a medical expense). </p>
</details>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p><strong>“All or substantially all” (90% or more)</strong> of the <strong>premiums</strong> paid relate to <strong>medical expenses</strong> that are <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return.html">eligible for the medical expense tax credit (METC)</a>

<h4>Insured plan (plan is backed by a contract of insurance)</h4>
<p>An insured plan meets the "all or substantially all" (generally 90% or more) requirement if “all or substantially all” of the <strong>premiums </strong>paid in the calendar year relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <strong>benefits </strong>paid to employees in the calendar year are not considered in determining whether the plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement.</p>
<p>The following example explains when the “all or substantially all” requirement will be met for an insured plan.</p>
<details><summary>Example - Insured plan</summary>
<p>The group employee insurance plan for Company XYZ covers the following four types of expenses:</p>

<p>This plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement because 92% (70% + 10% + 12%) of the premiums paid relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr>, while 8% of the premiums relate to other medical expenses. The fact that only 87% (69% + 11% + 7%) of the total benefits paid relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> is not relevant in determining whether the plan qualifies as a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr>.</p>
</details>

<h4>Self-insured plan (plan is not backed by a contract of insurance)</h4>
<p>When a plan is not backed by a contract of insurance, the CRA considers it to be a self-insured plan.</p>
<p>A self-insured plan meets the “all or substantially all” (generally 90% or more) requirement for a calendar year if “all or substantially all” of the <strong>benefits paid </strong>to <strong>all employees </strong>that year are for medical expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr>.</p>
<p>The following example explains when the “all or substantially all” requirement will be met for a self-insured plan.</p>

<p>This plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits paid to <strong>all employees </strong>in the year for medical expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> represent 93% ($9,000 + $3,000 + $800) of the total benefits ($13,800) paid.</p>
</details>
<p>If you provide benefits through a self-insured plan that consists of health care spending accounts (HCSAs), the method for determining whether the plan satisfies the “all or substantially all” requirement for a particular calendar year is the same as for self-insured plans that do not consist of a HCSA. The employees' allocation of the ceiling amount to the various types of expense in an HCSA is not considered.</p>
<p>Most employers that offer HCSAs do so under one group plan. However, in rare circumstances, each HCSA can be considered a separate insurance plan. The determination of whether one group plan or several individual plans exist must be based on the law and the facts of the case. For more information on HCSAs, see paragraphs 14 to 18 of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it529/archived-flexible-employee-benefit-programs.html">Interpretation Bulletin IT-529, Flexible Employee Benefit Programs</a>.</p>
<p>The following example explains when self-insured HCSAs would meet the “all or substantially all” requirement.</p>

<details><summary>Example - Health care spending accounts</summary>
<p>Company BBB provides one self-insured group plan that consists of three HCSAs, each with a $5,000 ceiling amount.  At the start of the calendar year, each employee allocates the $5,000 ceiling, as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>The plan shown above meets the “all or substantially all” requirement. The total benefits paid to all employees that year for expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> are 92% ($11,500) of the total benefits paid ($12,525). The fact that the total ceiling amounts allocated for expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> ($12,000) are only 80% of the total ceiling amount, eligible and non-eligible ($15,000), is not relevant in determining whether the plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement.</p>
<p>However, if each HCSA is determined to be a separate plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ann's plan satisfies the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits she received for expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> are 95% ($4,000) of the total benefits ($4,200) that she received in the year. </li>
<li>Sue's plan does not satisfy the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits she received for expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> are only 83% ($3,250) of the total benefits ($3,900) she received in the year. </li>
<li>Jim's plan satisfies the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits he received for expenses that are eligible for the <abbr title="Medical expense tax credit">METC</abbr> are 96% ($4,250) of the total benefits ($4,425) he received in the year. </li>
</ul>
</details>
<h4>Multiple plans</h4>
<p>Whether one or multiple plans exist is a question of fact and law. Multiple plans cannot be combined in determining if the “all or substantially all” requirement has been satisfied.</p>
