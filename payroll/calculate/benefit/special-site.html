 <div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Content has been updated for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the current CRA administrative policy. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>Generally, if you provide a benefit or an <a href="#allowance" aria-controls="allowance" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">allowance <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> for board and lodging, or transportation to your employee, the benefit or allowance is taxable. </p>

<p>Depending on your situation, the board and lodging, or transportation benefit or allowance you provide to your employee who works at a special work site may not have to be included in your employee's income. Where the benefit must be included in your employee’s income, the value of the benefit will be based on its fair market value (FMV).</p>

<details><summary>What is the fair market value (FMV)</summary>
<div data-ajax-replace="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/benefit/ajax/fmv.txt"></div>
<p>Generally, if you provide <strong>meals and short-term accommodations</strong> to your employee, it is subject to GST/HST. If the benefit is taxable, include the GST/HST in the value of the benefit.</p>

<li> <h3 id="step1">Determine if another exception applies to the benefit or allowance</h3>
<p>If you provide a benefit or an allowance for board and lodging or transportation, your employee may be working at a location that is both considered a <strong>special work site</strong> and a <strong>remote work location</strong>. However, the benefit can only be excluded from the employee's income <strong>once</strong>.</p>

</ul>
</li>

<li> <h3 id="step2">Determine if the work location is considered a special work site</h3>
<div id="ajax-special">
<p>Generally, a special work site is an area where temporary duties are performed by your employee who keeps a self-contained domestic establishment (SCDE) at another location as their principal place of residence for which the work location is not considered reasonable for your employee to return daily.</p>
<div data-ajax-replace="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/benefit/ajax/def-scde.txt"></div>
<h4>What CRA generally considers to be a special work site</h4>
<p>The CRA considers a location to be a special work site based on the following factors: </p>
<ol class="lst-stps-sub stps-strpd">
<li> <details open><summary>Determine if the duties performed by your employee are considered temporary</summary>
<div id="ajax-temp">
<p>Generally, the CRA considers that your employee’s duties are temporary (performed on a short-term or interim basis) if it can <strong>reasonably</strong> be expected that they will <strong>not</strong> provide continuous employment for your employee beyond a period of <strong>more than 2 years</strong>. In determining the expected duration of employment, use the facts known at the time your employee started working for you. </p>

<p>To determine if the work is considered temporary, the CRA considers the following factors:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The nature of the duties to be performed by your employee. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The total estimated duration of a project or the specific portion of the project for which your employee is hired. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The agreed period of time for which your employee was hired according to the employment contract or other terms of the engagement. </li>
</ul>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md">This must be based on a <strong>thorough review of the facts in each specific situation</strong>.</p>

<li><details><summary>Determine if the distance between your employee’s principal place of residence and the work location is not considered reasonable for your employee to return daily</summary>
<div id="ajax-80km">
<p id="step2c">Generally, the CRA considers that it is <strong>not</strong> reasonable for your employee to travel between their principal place of residence and the work location if the distance between those 2 places by the most direct route normally taken is <strong>more than 80 kilometres</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if the distance is less than 80 kilometres, the CRA may still consider that it is not reasonable for your employee to make that trip after taking into account factors such as:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The number of hours of work required of your employee at the special work site each shift </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The time your employee would have for rest if they returned home daily  </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The means of transportation available and condition of the route that would be travelled (for example: the quality of roadway, seasonal weather conditions) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee’s general physical and mental health  </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The time it takes to travel the distance, and the time of day the travel takes place</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Special situation - <strong>Fishers and seafarers</strong></summary>
<p>A ship may qualify as a special work location if it is <strong>at sea for 36 hours or more</strong> and the employee is <strong>required to remain on board</strong>.</p>
<p> The duties performed by the employee must be of a <strong>temporary nature</strong> and <strong>all other conditions must be met</strong>.</p>

<p>Determining if the ship qualifies as a special work location for your employee depends on the facts of each situation. Each case is unique and requires a thorough review of the facts.</p>

<h4>Factors to consider</h4>
<p>Both the <strong>ship as a workplace</strong> and its <strong>location at sea</strong> are factors that are considered to qualify as a special work location.</p>

<p>Time spent at sea may include time on board due to:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Quarantine </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Waiting to dock </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Loading or unloading cargo (if the stop is brief and the ship is in transit)</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Waiting for immigration or customs clearance </li>
</ul>
<p>However, just because an employee works on different employer-owned ships does not automatically mean they are in various “temporary” employments. This distinction is necessary for the benefit related to a special work site to be excluded from their income.</p>

<p>You and your employee <strong>must</strong> fill out  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/td4.html">Form TD4</a> Declaration of Exemption - Employment at a Special Work Site to exclude the amounts from your employee’s income. </p>
<p>You should fill out the form when one of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee begins their employment at a special work site </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee’s situation at a special work site changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you fill out Form TD4, <strong>do not</strong> include these amounts on the T4 slip using code 30 or box 14 (or code 028 on a T4A slip if you are not their employer). </p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> keep the completed Form TD4 with your employee’s records. <strong>Do not</strong> send the CRA a copy.</p>

<h4>Special situation: Excluded board and lodging, and transportation provided at a special work site in a prescribed zone</h4>
<p>If you provided the excluded benefit or allowance to your employee at a <strong>special work site in a prescribed zone</strong> and your employee <strong>kept their principal place of residence</strong> outside a prescribed zone, you must report the exempt part that is related to work sites: </p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Within <strong>30 kilometres</strong> from the nearest urban area</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">With a population of at least <strong>40,000 persons</strong></li>
</ul>
	
<p>You <strong>must</strong> include the amount on the T4 slip using codes 31 (or code 124 on the T4A slip if you are not the employer of the employee). </p>

<p>Your employee will use this amount to calculate the Northern Residents deduction on their income tax and benefit return.</p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<h4>Situation</h4>
<p>The employer paid the employee $4,000 for board and lodging at a special work site in a prescribed zone. </p>
<p>The employer and the employee completed Form TD4, Declaration of Exemption – Employment at a Special Work Site. </p>
<p>Of the $4,000 the employer paid, $1,200 relates to a special work site that was located 27 kilometres from a town with a population of 43,000 people (the 30-kilometre part).</p>
<h4>Result</h4>
<p>The employer must enter $1,200 using code 31 of the T4 slip, even though it was not entered using code 30.</p>
<p>The employee will enter $1,200 on their Form T2222, Northern Residents Deductions.</p>
