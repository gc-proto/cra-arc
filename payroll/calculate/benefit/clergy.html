<p>On this webpage, the term “Member of the clergy” is used to describe an individual who is member of the clergy, a regular minister or a member of a religious order.</p>
    </div>
 </div>

<p>Generally, if you provide free or low-rent accommodation or utilities or an <a href="#allowance" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">allowance&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> for housing or utilities to your employee, the benefit or allowance is taxable. This includes situations where you provide your employee with housing rent-free or for less than the fair market value (FMV) of the accommodation.</p>

<p>Depending on the situation, your employee who is a member of the clergy may be able to claim a deduction from their employment income for their residence when filing a personal income tax return. If they choose to claim this deduction, you may have to reduce the income used to calculate CPP and income tax withholdings by the amount of the deduction.</p>

<dt> Member of the clergy </dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-clergy"><p>A <strong>member of the clergy</strong> is a person set apart from the other members as a spiritual leader within a church or religious denomination.</p>
<p>The following should be considered to determine whether a person is a member of the clergy or not:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognition process:</strong> It is not necessary for the appointment process to be called "ordination" or to be conducted by higher authorities in the religious organization. The congregation itself can formally recognize the individual. It is sufficient that there is a formal or legitimate act of recognition, requiring a serious and  long-term commitment to the ministry.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> This category includes various religious leaders, such as:
<ul>
<li>Priests, pastors, ministers, rabbis and imams</li>
<li>Commended workers and other persons who have been licensed, commissioned, or recognized formally or legitimately within their religious organization </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul> 
</div></dd>

<dt> Regular minister </dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-minister"><p>A <strong>regular minister</strong> is a person who meets  the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authority to perform spiritual duties:</strong> The individual is authorized to perform spiritual duties, conduct religious services, administer sacraments, and carry out similar religious functions. These duties may include:
<ul>
<li>Participating in the conduct of religious services</li>
<li>Administering rituals, ordinances, or sacraments </li>
<li>Providing pastoral care to specific members or groups within the religious organization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Legitimate appointment:</strong> The person is appointed or recognized by a body or person with the power to appoint or ordain ministers on behalf of or within the denomination.</li>
<li><strong>Position or appointment of permanence:</strong> The appointment is of some permanence within the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply performing the duties of a minister is not enough to be considered a "regular minister". A legitimate appointment or recognition is required. </p>
</div></dd>
<dt>Religious denomination</dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-religious-den"> <p>A <strong>religious denomination</strong> is a group of individuals who are called by  the same name and have a distinct system of religious faith or belief.</p>
<p>The group’s specific religious beliefs, ideology, or practices are distinct enough to distinguish the members of the group from those of society as a whole.</p>	
</div></dd>
<dt> Religious order </dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-religious"> 
<p>Your employee is considered a member of a <strong>religious order</strong> if they are part of a <strong>group</strong> of people bound by the same religious, moral, and social rules and discipline.</p>
 
<p><strong>Not</strong> all religious organizations are religious orders. Whether a <strong>group or part of a group</strong> is considered a religious order is a <strong>question of fact</strong> that you must determine <strong>on a case-by-case basis</strong>.</p>
<p>The following criteria <strong>indicate that the organisation is a religious order</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and ">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The group will have a shared faith with specific beliefs and principles that the group requires the members to uphold</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Members are required to engage in activities that support the religious mission, which may include:
<ul>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Religious missions or education</li>
<li>Social outreach or counseling</li>
<li>Relief and development work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The purpose of the organization should be primarily religious. </li>

<dt> Appointment of a religious order or religious denomination  </dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-app"><p>A person’s administrative responsibilities must be <strong>appointed by a religious order or denomination</strong>.  </p>
<p>A recommendation or commendation (as distinct from appointment) of a person for administrative responsibilities with another organization is not considered appointment by the order or denomination. The appointment does not need to be for employment with the denomination or order. The appointment can be to a position with an entity that is controlled by, and that is an integral part of the denomination. The appointment should be in accordance with the practices and procedures of the religious organization. </p> </div></dd>

<dt> Congregation</dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-congregation"><p>A <strong>congregation</strong> is not defined by a specific church structure, territory, or the number of people gathered. A congregation is a group of people assembled to receive spiritual counseling, advice, inspiration, and support from a minister.</p>

<p>The following criteria should be considered when determining whether a group qualifies as a congregation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of students assembled for academic instruction is not a congregation.</li>
<li>Congregations do not require fixed membership. They can have diverse or fluid membership, and do not necessitate that all members attend voluntarily or share the same religious beliefs.</li>
<li>Ministers or spiritual leaders may serve multiple congregations, not necessarily just one.</li>
<li> Chaplains in hospitals, prisons, the military, and similar institutions are generally considered to minister to congregations. </li>
</ul>
</div></dd>

<dt> Full-time administrative service  </dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-full"><p><strong>Administrative service</strong> generally describes the functions of determining organizational policies and coordinating various activities of the organization at the management level. It is not limited to the senior level of management of an organization. However, performing specific support functions such as accounting, groundskeeping, information technology and clerical work does not qualify as administrative service. </p>
<p>A person who meets the status test who is employed in a full-time administrative position is considered to be working exclusively and full-time in a qualifying function even if, in addition to administrative responsibilities, the person also engages in incidental ministering activities that would satisfy the function test. <strong>Exclusively</strong> and <strong>full-time</strong> here imply that the person does not have some other form of appointment, business or occupation that is in addition to, and impinges upon, the administrative work performed. </p>

<p>Teaching is not considered to be administrative service, whether or not it is at a denominational school, college or seminary. Occasional or incidental teaching will not disqualify a person whose full-time responsibility is qualifying administrative service.</p>  </div></dd>

<dt> Ministering  </dt>
<dd><div id="ajax-def-ministering"><p><strong>Ministering</strong> is a very broad concept of serving or attending to the needs of a congregation, diocese or parish, or its individual members. This should be looked at in the context of the religious organization's practices and expectations.</p>
<p> If a person who meets the status test is employed within a congregation, they are considered to be ministering to a congregation if they are fulfilling a pastoral or ministerial role in the manner requested by that congregation. If a person who meets the status test is employed by a religious organization outside the order or religious denomination, they are considered to be ministering to a congregation such as a church, a chaplaincy audience, or a disadvantaged group if they are fulfilling a pastoral or ministerial role consistent with the religious ministry of the organization in which such person has status. </p>
<p>A person who meets the status test ministers on a part-time or assistant basis or performs specialized ministering will satisfy the function test. As long as ministering to congregations is an integral part of their employment responsibilities and expectations, that activity will qualify. </p> </div></dd>
