<p>Generally, if you use the rate prescribed in section 7306 of the <abbr title="Income Tax Regulations">ITR</abbr> to cover your employee’s main costs of owning and operating their own vehicle as part of their employment duties, it is considered reasonable. </p>
<p>If you use a rate that is <strong>lower or higher</strong> than the prescribed rate, it may <strong>not</strong> be considered reasonable. </p>
<p><strong>All of the facts</strong> relevant to your employee’s situation must be considered to determine if a lower or higher rate is considered reasonable. For example, factors such as the type of vehicle, the driving conditions, or a higher fuel cost at a specific location, may be situations where you determine that the reasonable rates are higher or lower.</p>

<p>However, if you pay your employee an allowance based on a per-kilometer rate that is <strong>not</strong> considered reasonable in the situation, the allowance is taxable.</p>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>

<p>If you provide an allowance to your employee for using their own vehicle, the allowance is taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the above conditions are <strong>not</strong> met.</p>
<p>The following are examples of taxable situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The per-kilometre rates are not considered reasonable because they are either <strong>too high or too low</strong> </li>
<li>You provided a <strong>flat-rate</strong> allowance that is <strong>not</strong> based on the number of kilometres driven </li>
<li>You <strong>combined</strong> allowances for which you used a flat-rate and a reasonable per-kilometre rate for the same use of the vehicle (the combined amount is considered 1 allowance) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you provide an accountable advance to cover the expenses your employee will incur for using their own vehicle in the course of or in connection with your employee’s employment which <strong>does not</strong> meet all the conditions above, the advance is taxable.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: You are <strong>averaging</strong> allowances to your employee </summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you provide your employee with a <strong>flat-rate or lump-sum allowance</strong> that is <strong>not</strong> based on the number of kilometres driven, you <strong>cannot</strong> average the allowances at the end of the year to determine a <a href="#what-rate" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">reasonable per-kilometre rate&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. </p>
<p>The allowances are taxable and must be included in your employee’s income.  </p>

<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Where you provide allowances based on the number of kilometres driven calculated using a reasonable per-kilometre rate, your employees have to file expense claims with you on an ongoing basis, starting at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>To reduce the burden on employers from the administrative problems this can create, if you provide allowances to employees for vehicle expenses in advance, the allowances may not be taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You have a pre-established per-kilometre rate starting at the beginning of the year </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The rate and the advances are reasonable under the circumstances and you can justify your position</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You record this method in your employee’s file </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">No other provision of the Income Tax Act requires you to include the advances in your employee’s income</li>
</ul>

 <h5>What to do at the end of the year</h5>
<p>In addition to the above conditions, your employee must also account for the business (employment-related) kilometres they travelled and any advances they received. They have to do this on the <strong>date their employment ends in the year</strong> or <strong>by December 31, whichever is earlier</strong>. At that time, you need to review the total amount of allowances or advances you paid using the following calculation:</p>
