            <p>If your net self-employment income or pensionable employment income is <strong>more than $3,500</strong>, you have to contribute to the CPP.</p>
            <p>You need to calculate the amount of CPP you have to contribute when you complete your income tax and benefit return (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-22200-deduction-cpp-qpp-contributions-on-self-employment-other-earnings.html">line 22200</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-31000-cpp-qpp-contributions-on-self-employment-other-earnings.html">line 31000</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-42100-cpp-contributions-payable-on-self-employment-other-earnings.html">line 42100</a>, and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s8.html">Schedule 8</a>).</p>

<h3>First Nations workers who are self-employed</h3>
<p>If you are a self-employed <a href="#fnterm" aria-controls="fnterm" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">First Nations worker <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> exempt from tax, you can elect to pay CPP on your tax-exempt self-employment income by filing out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt20.html">Form CPT20, Election to Pay Canada Pension Plan Contributions</a> when filing your personal income tax return.</p>
   
<h2 id="h_10">What is the CPP enhancement</h2>
<p>From 2003 to 2018, employees were making a contribution of 4.95% on their pensionable earnings up to their annual maximum pensionable earnings (first ceiling), with employers making an equal contribution. These are the <strong>base contributions </strong>to the CPP. </p>
<p>From 2019 to 2023, the contribution rate for employees was increased gradually from 4.95% to 5.95%. These are the base contributions (4.95%) and the <strong>first additional contribution</strong> to the CPP (1%).</p>
<p>In 2024, an additional maximum pensionable earnings (second higher ceiling) was introduced. Employees and employers are required to make a <strong>second additional CPP contribution (CPP2)</strong> on these earnings, beginning at the first earnings ceiling and going up to the second earnings ceiling, at a rate of 4.0%. </p>
