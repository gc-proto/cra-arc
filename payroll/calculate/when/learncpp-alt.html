 <h2 id="h_1">What are CPP pensionable earnings</h2>
<p>Pensionable earnings are the employee's remuneration from pensionable office or employment with certain exceptions.</p>

            <p>Generally, you must deduct CPP contributions from:</p>
             <ul class="fa-ul">
	      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Salary, wages or other remuneration </li>
               <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Commissions </li>
               <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Bonuses </li>
               <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Most taxable benefits </li>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <p><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg text-success"></span> You have to <strong>deduct</strong> CPP contributions from your employee's pensionable earnings if your employee meets <strong>one</strong> of the following conditions:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>The employee is in pensionable employment during the year</li>
    <li>The employee is between 18 and 69 years old, even if receiving a CPP or QPP retirement pension</li>
    <li>The employee is not considered disabled under the CPP or QPP</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Employer CPP contributions></h3>
<p>You <strong>must also contribute an amount equal</strong> to the CPP contributions that you deduct from your employees' remuneration and remit the total of both amounts. Even if the required deductions were not made, you are <strong>deemed </strong>to have made them and the deductions not being made may result in a PIER. </p>

</li>

 <li class="cnjnctn-col"> <p><span class="fas fa-times fa-lg text-danger"></span>  You <strong>do not</strong> have to deduct CPP contributions from your employee's pensionable earnings if your employee meets <strong>one</strong> of the following conditions:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>The employee is under 18 or 70 years old or older</li>
    <li>The employee is considered disabled under CPP or QPP</li>
    <li>The employee is between 65 and 69 and has submitted Form CPT30 to stop contributing</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

  <details><summary>What is the CPP enhancement</summary>  
<p>From 2003 to 2018, employees were making a contribution of 4.95% on their pensionable earnings up to their annual maximum pensionable earnings (first ceiling), with employers making an equal contribution. These are the <strong>base contributions </strong>to the CPP. </p>
<p>From 2019 to 2023, the contribution rate for employees was increased gradually from 4.95% to 5.95%. These are the base contributions (4.95%) and the <strong>first additional contribution</strong> to the CPP (1%).</p>
<p>In 2024, an additional maximum pensionable earnings (second higher ceiling) was introduced. Employees and employers are required to make a <strong>second additional CPP contribution (CPP2)</strong> on these earnings, beginning at the first earnings ceiling and going up to the second earnings ceiling, at a rate of 4.0%. </p>
</details> 

 <h2 id="h_3">How to calculate in special situations</h2>

You must also deduct CPP contributions from any amounts and benefits that are earned by or owed to your employee on the date of death.  </p>
<h4>How to prorate</h4>
<p>When prorating, use the number of months up to and including the month of death.</p>

<h3>How to apply for CPP coverage</h3>
<details><summary>Election by the <strong>employer</strong></summary>
<p>You have the option to extend CPP coverage to your First Nations employees who are exempt from tax by filing out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt124.html">Form CPT124, Application to Cover the Employment of an Indian in Canada Under the Canada Pension Plan Whose Income is Exempt Under the Income Tax Act</a>.</p>

<p>However, you cannot revoke this election and you have to cover all First Nations employees. </p>

<h4>When to start CPP contributions</h4>
<p>If all conditions are met and you signed Form CPT124, you must start deducting CPP contributions on either the date you sign the application or on a later date that you specify. It cannot be retroactive to a date before the date you signed the application.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Election by the <strong>employee</strong></summary>
<p>If you do not choose to cover CPP for your First Nations employees who are exempt from tax, a First Nations employee can elect to pay CPP on tax-exempt earnings by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt20.html">Form CPT20, Election to Pay Canada Pension Plan Contributions</a> when filing their personal income tax return.</p>

          <p>You may have an establishment in Quebec and in another province or territory. If you transfer an employee from Quebec to another province or territory, you can take into account the QPP contributions you deducted from that employee throughout the year when calculating the maximum CPP contributions to deduct. </p>

<p>The following formula reconciles the amounts contributed to the CPP and QPP to make sure that enough contributions to the CPP are withheld and future benefits are not affected:</p>

            <p>In addition to deducting CPP/QPP contributions, you will also have to prepare <strong>two T4 slips</strong>. </p>

 <h3 id="h_3a">Employee situations - Prorating not required</h3>
 <details><summary>Your employee works for <strong>more than 1 employer</strong></summary>
<p>The CPP annual maximum pensionable earnings apply to <strong>each job </strong>the employee holds with <strong>different employers </strong>(different business numbers). </p>
<p id="h_0_1">If an employee leaves one employer during the year to start work with another employer, the new employer also has to deduct CPP contributions without taking into account what the previous employer paid. This is the case even if the employee has contributed the maximum amount during the previous employment.</p>
<p>Any overpayments will be refunded to employees when they file their income tax and benefit returns. As an employer, you <strong>are not </strong>entitled to a refund for the employer's share of the contributions.</p>

<details><summary>Your employee works <strong>outside Canada</strong> and you have a business in Canada</summary>  
 <div id="ajax-outside">
<p>If you are a Canadian employer and if you have employees working outside Canada, you must deduct CPP contributions if <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</p>
<div id="ajax-cpp-outside">
    <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or ">
   	<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee usually reports for work at your place of business in Canada</li>
	<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee is a Canadian resident and is paid from your place of business in Canada</li>
   </ul>
</div>
<p>However, even if the employment <strong>does not</strong> meet the above conditions, international social security agreements may require the employment to be pensionable.</p>
<div id="ajax-cpp-outside2">
<p>You may have the option to extend CPP coverage to your employees or your employee may have the option to file for CPP coverage if they meet the conditions to make the employment pensionable.</p>

<h3>How to apply for CPP coverage</h3>
<details><summary>Election by the <strong>employer</strong></summary>

<h4>What to do if your employee may be subject to a foreign social security plan</h4>
<p>Canada has reciprocal social security agreements with certain other countries to ensure that only one plan covers an employee, either the CPP or a foreign social security plan. To find out if a particular country has an agreement with Canada and which CPT application form to use, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/international-social-security-agreements-canada-pension-plan/what-purpose-international-social-security-agreements.html">What is the purpose of international social security agreements?</a></p>
