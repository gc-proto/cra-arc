 <h2 id="h_1">What are EI insurable earnings</h2>  

<p>Insurable earnings are the employee's earnings from insurable employment. <strong>Insurable employment </strong>includes most employment in Canada under a <strong>contract of service</strong>.</p>
<p>To be considered as insurable earnings, the amount has to be paid in cash by the person's employer and received and enjoyed by the person in respect of that employment. </p>
<p>Generally, you have to deduct EI premiums from:</p>

 <ul class="fa-ul">
	      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Salary, wages or other remuneration </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Commissions </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Bonuses </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Most taxable benefits received in cash </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Honorariums </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Certain tips and gratuities </li>
</ul>

<p>To determine if you need to deduct EI premiums, refer to:</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/payment/index.html">Determine the tax treatment of payments other than regular employment income</a> </li>
</ul>
 
 <h2 id="h_2">When to deduct EI premiums</h2>
<p>You have to deduct EI premiums from your employee’s insurable earnings. </p>
<p>EI premiums:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">start to be deducted from the first dollar earned up to the yearly maximum </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">have <strong>no age limit </strong>for deducting them </li>
</ul>

<h3>Employer EI contributions</h3>                
<p>You <strong>must also contribute 1.4 times the amount of </strong>the EI premiums that you deduct from your employees' remuneration and remit the total of both amounts. Even if the required deductions were not made, you are <strong>deemed </strong>to have made them and the deductions not being made may result in a PIER. </p>

<h2 id="h_5">When to stop deducting EI premiums</h2>
 <div id="ajax-stopei">
  <p>For current employees, <strong>stop</strong> deducting EI premiums <strong>when the employee’s annual insurable earnings reach the maximum insurable earnings or the maximum employee premium</strong> for the year in their <strong>employment with you</strong>.</p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/cpp-ei-explained/canada-pension-plan-employment-insurance-explained-10.html">Pensionable and insurable earnings - CPP/EI explained</a> </p>  
</div>

<h2 id="h_6">What if the employee has different jobs</h2>
<p>The EI annual maximum insurable earnings apply to <strong>each job </strong>the employee holds with different employers (different business numbers). </p>

 <details><summary>What happens if your employee has <strong>multiple employers</strong></summary>
<p id="h_0_1">If an employee leaves one employer during the year to start work with another employer, the new employer also has to deduct EI premiums without taking into account what the previous employer paid. This is the case even if the employee has contributed the maximum amount during the previous employment.</p>
<p>Any overpayments will be refunded to employees when they file their income tax and benefit returns. As an employer, you <strong>are not </strong>entitled to a refund for the employer's share of the contributions.</p>

 <h2 id="h_9">What to do if you have employees whose province of employment is Quebec</h2>
<p>If you have employees whose province of employment is Quebec, <strong>regardless of your employee's province or territory of residence</strong>, you have to deduct a reduced employment insurance (EI) premium using the <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/when/eirates.html#tb2">Quebec EI premium rates and maximums</a> in addition to the Québec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) premiums.</p>

       <details><summary>What to do if you <strong>transfer an employee between Quebec and another province or territory</strong></summary>
<p>You may have a place of business in Quebec and in another province or territory. If you transfer an employee from Quebec to another part of Canada, in addition to deducting EI/QPIP premiums, you will also have to prepare two T4 slips. </p>
<p>It is important that you calculate and report the proper deductions and insurable earnings on both T4 slips. </p>
</details> 

 <h2 id="h_7b">What to do if you have employees outside Canada</h2>

<p>If you have employees working outside (or partly outside) Canada, you must deduct EI premiums if <strong>all</strong> of the following applies:</p>
<div id="ajax-ei-outside">
    <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
   <li class="cnjnctn-col">You, as the employer, reside in Canada or have a place of business in Canada</li>

	<li class="cnjnctn-col">The employment is not excluded from insurable employment for any other reason</li>      
   </ul>

<p class="mrgn-tp-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger fa-lg"></span> <strong>Do not</strong> deduct EI if the above conditions are not met.</p>

   <h2 id="h_10">What to do if you are self-employed</h2>
<p>If you are self-employed, participation in the EI program is <strong>voluntary</strong>.</p>
<p>You are eligible to participate if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and ">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>do not </strong>work as a barber, hairdresser, fisher, taxi driver, or a driver of other passenger vehicles </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You either operate your own business <strong>or </strong>work for and control more than 40% of the voting shares of a corporation </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a fisher, a barber, a hairdresser, or if you drive a taxi or other passenger vehicle, you do not need to register for the self-employed program. People in these professions should apply for EI benefits as an employee.</p>

 <h2 id="h_11"> What is the EI Premium Reduction Program</h2>
<div id="ajax-redrate">
<p>If you provide a wage loss replacement plan for short-term disability to your employees, you can request a reduced EI premium rate through Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). </p>
<p><strong>If approved </strong>you will have a <strong>reduced EI premium rate </strong>that is less than the standard 1.4 times the employee premium (for example, 1.24 times).</p>
<p>Your reduced rate <strong>only </strong>applies to employees who are covered by the approved plan.</p>
<p>In this situation, you will require an additional payroll deduction program account to make separate remittances for employees not covered by the plan.</p>
