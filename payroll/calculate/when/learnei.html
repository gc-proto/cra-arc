 <h2 id="h_1">What are EI insurable earnings</h2>  

<p>Insurable earnings are the total amount of earnings that a person has from all insurable employment. <strong>Insurable employment </strong>includes most employment in Canada under a <strong>contract of service</strong>.</p>
<p>To be considered as insurable earnings, the amount has to be paid in cash by the person's employer and received and enjoyed by the person in respect of that employment. </p>
<p>Generally, you have to deduct EI premiums from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Salary, wages or other remuneration </li>
<li>Commissions </li>
<li>Bonuses </li>
<li>Most taxable benefits received in cash </li>
<li>Honorariums </li>
<li>Certain tips and gratuities </li>
</ul>

<p>To determine if you need to deduct EI premiums based on your situation, refer to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/benefit/index.html">Determine if a benefit is taxable</a> </li>
<li><a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/payment/index.html">Determine the tax treatment of payments other than regular employment income</a> </li>
</ul>
 
 <h2 id="h_2">When to deduct EI premiums</h2>
<p>Employers and their employees have to pay EI premiums on earnings from insurable employment.</p>
<p>EI premiums:</p>

<ul>
<li>are payable from the first dollar earned up to the yearly maximum </li>
<li>have <strong>no age limit </strong>for deducting them </li>
</ul>
            
<p>You <strong>must also contribute 1.4 times the amount of </strong>the EI premiums that you deduct from your employees' remuneration and remit the total amount. Even if the required deductions were not made, you are <strong>deemed </strong>to have made them.</p>

      
<h2 id="h_5">When to stop deducting EI premiums</h2>
 <div id="ajax-stopei">
  <p>For current employees, <strong>stop</strong> deducting EI when the employee <strong>reaches the maximum premium</strong> for the year in their <strong>employment with you</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="h_6">What if the employee has different jobs</h2>
<p>The EI annual maximum insurable earnings apply to <strong>each job </strong>the employee holds with different employers even if the maximum premium has been reached during the previous employment.</p>

<h3 id="h_0_1">Multiple employers</h3>
<p>If an employee leaves one employer during the year to start work with another employer, the new employer also has to deduct EI premiums without taking into account what the previous employer paid. This is the case even if the employee has contributed the maximum amount during the previous employment.</p>
<p>Any overpayments will be refunded to employees when they file their income tax and benefit returns. You <strong>are not </strong>entitled to a refund for the employer's share of the contributions.</p>

<h3 id="h_0_2">Employer restructuring</h3>
<p>Where there was an employer restructuring, the successor employer may consider the amounts of EI deducted, remitted or paid by the former employer for the employment of the employees for the year as if they had been deducted, remitted, or paid by the successor employer. </p>

            <h2 id="h_9">What to do if you have a business in Quebec</h2>
<p>If you have employees working in Quebec, <strong>regardless of your employee's province or territory of residence</strong>, you have to deduct a reduced employment insurance (EI) premium using the <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/when/eirates.html#tb2">Quebec EI premium rates and maximums</a> in addition to the QPIP premiums.</p>

            <h3>What to do if you transfer an employee from Quebec to another province or territory</h3>
<p>You may have a place of business in Quebec and one in another province or territory. If you transfer an employee from Quebec to another province or territory. In addition to deducting EI/QPIP premiums, you will also have to prepare two T4 slips. </p>
<p>It is important that you calculate and report the proper deductions and insurable/pensionable earnings on both T4 slips. </p>


   <h2 id="h_10">What to do if you are self-employed</h2>
<p>If you are self-employed, the participation in the EI program is <strong>voluntary</strong>.</p>
<p>You are eligible to participate if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>You <strong>do not </strong>work as a barber, hairdresser, fisher, taxi driver, or a driver of other passenger vehicles </li>
<li>You are a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada. </li>
<li>You either operate your own business <strong>or </strong>work for and control more than 40% of the voting shares of a corporation </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a barber, a hairdresser, a fisher, a taxi driver, or a driver of other passenger vehicles  barber, If you are in these professions, you should apply for EI benefits as an employee.</p>

 <h2 id="h_11"> What is the EI Premium Reduction Program</h2>
<p>If you provide a wage loss replacement plan for short-term disability to your employees, you can request a reduced EI premium rate through Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). </p>
<p><strong>If approved </strong>you will have a <strong>reduced EI premium rate </strong>that is less than the standard 1.4 times the employee premium (for example, 1.24 times).</p>
<p>Your reduced rate <strong>only </strong>applies to employees who are covered by the approved plan.</p>
<p>In this situation, you will require an additional payroll deduction program account to make separate remittances for employees not covered by the plan.</p>
