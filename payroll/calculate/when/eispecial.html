<p>If your employee is related to you (individually or as a corporation) as their employer, they may not be in insurable employment. However, the related employee can be in insurable employment if you would have negotiated a similar contract with a person with whom you deal at arm’s length. </p>

    <p>Under the Employment Insurance Act, <strong>employees who are related to their employer</strong> (individual or corporation) might not be in an insurable employment. This means that they would not have <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premiums deducted from their pay and would not be able to get <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> benefits.</p>
<p>There are several ways employees are considered to be related to the employer. They can be related:</p>
<ul>
<li>By a blood relationship</li>
<li>By marriage</li>
<li>By common-law partnership</li>
<li>By adoption</li>
<li>Where the employer is a corporation, the employee is considered related to the corporation when they are related to a person who either controls the corporation or is a member of a related group that controls the corporation</li>
</ul>

     <p>This does not mean the employment of a family member is automatically not insurable.

   <p>However, these individuals can be in insurable employment if you would have negotiated a similar contract with a person with whom&nbsp;you deal&nbsp;at arm's length.</p>
<p>You have to look at all the circumstances of the employment to see if someone else would have been hired under a similar contract of employment. The circumstances that&nbsp;we look&nbsp;at include:</p>

<div id="ajax-redrate">
<p>If you provide a wage loss replacement plan for short-term disability to your employees, you can request a reduced <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premium rate through Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). </p>
<p><strong>If approved </strong>you will have a <strong>reduced <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premium rate </strong>that is less than the standard 1.4 times the employee premium (for example, 1.24 times).</p>
<p>Your reduced rate <strong>only </strong>applies to employees who are covered by the approved plan.</p>
<p>In this situation, you will require an additional payroll deduction program account to make separate remittances for employees not covered by the plan.</p>
