<h4>Opening a separate payroll account</h4>
<p>You will need to send a request to the CRA to open a separate <a href="#account" aria-controls="mid-screen" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">payroll account&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> under your existing business number for employees participating in a wage-loss replacement plan for short-term disability. </p>
<p>Once ESDC approved your request for the EI premium reduction rate, you have to confirm to the CRA and ESDC which account will be assigned as the EI premium reduction rate account.</p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/register/index.html">Open or manage a payroll account</a></p>

<h4>Calculating EI premiums</h4>
<p><strong>Once approved by ESDC</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You will have a <strong>reduced <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premium rate </strong>that is less than the standard 1.4 times the employee premium (for example, 1.24 times)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your reduced rate will <strong>only</strong> apply to employees who are covered by the approved plan, including employees serving an eligibility period under the plan of 3 months or less</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reporting on T4 slips</h4>
<p>You have to report on separate T4 slips for each payroll account under your <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payroll account at the EI premium reduction rate (for example, RP0001) for employees covered under an approved plan</li>
<li>Payroll account at the standard rate of 1.4 times the employee's premiums (for example, RP0002) for employees who are <strong>not</strong> covered by the plan</li>
</ul>
<p>Where an employee was transferred between both accounts in the same calendar year, file a separate T4 slip for each account.</p>

  <div class="tgl-panel">
  <div tabindex="0">
<p>Individuals are <strong>related to each other</strong> if they are in a common-law partnership with each other. The CRA considers that 2 individuals are in a common-law partnership in one of the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They live together in a conjugal relationship and have done so for a continuous period of at least 12 months</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They live together in a conjugal relationship and have a child together (this includes through adoption), in which case the 12-month period does not apply</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also related to anyone connected by blood relationship (parents and siblings) to their common-law partner. </p>

<p>If there is a <strong>breakdown in the relationship</strong>, they are considered to continue to live in a common-law partnership until they have lived separate and apart for <strong>90 consecutive days</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, the person may be related by adoption to any children of their common-law partner, depending on the circumstances. <a href="#adopt">Adoption</a>. </p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Jack and Jill had a child together. They began living together in a conjugal relationship 1 month before their child was born.</p>
