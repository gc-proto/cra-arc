<p>If your employee turns <strong>18</strong> in the year, you must start deducting <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> from the first pay dated in the month after your employee turns 18. </p>
<p>For example, if your employee turns 18 on March 20, 20X5, you must start deducting <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions from the first pay dated in the month of April 20X5.</p>
<h4>How to prorate</h4>

<p>If your employee turns <strong>70</strong> in the year, you must continue to deduct <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions up to and including the last pay dated in the month when your employee turns 70. </p>
<p>For example, if your employee turns 70 on March 20, 20X5, you must stop deducting <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions after the last pay dated in the month of March 20X5.</p>

</ul>
<h4>When is the election considered made</h4>
<p>The election is considered to have been made when your employee gives you a copy of the completed and signed Form CPT30. </p>
<h4>When to stop <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions</h4>
<p>If your employee meets all of the above conditions and gives you a signed Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt30.html">CPT30 Election to Stop Contributing to the Canada Pension Plan, or Revocation of a Prior Election</a> with parts A, B and C completed, you must stop deducting CPP contributions on the first pay in the month following the month your employee has given you the signed copy of this form. </p>
<p>For example, if Form CPT30 is signed on March 20, 20X5 and given to you on the next day, the election is effective as of April 1, 20X5.</p>

<p> They must also provide you with:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Proof of age</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Proof that you are receiving a <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Quebec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> retirement pension (for example, a copy of the award letter) </li>
</ul>

<p>If Form CPT30 is dated in the past and was either provided to a different employer or your employee providing it to you was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, the form can be accepted. However, the form must reflect the actual date it was completed, backdating is not permitted.</p>

<p>Make sure to keep a copy of all completed CPT30 forms with your payroll records.  </p>

<h4>How to prorate</h4>
<p>When prorating, use the number of months up to and including the month before the election becomes effective. </p>

<h5>What if you over deducted <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions</h5>
<p>If you deducted <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions from your employee after the effective date of the election, these contributions are considered a <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> overpayment.</p>

<h4>What if the worker is self-employed</h4>
<p>A self-employed worker cannot use Form CPT30 to elect to stop contributing to the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> for their self-employed earnings. Instead, they must complete the Schedule 8, Canada Pension Plan Contributions and Overpayment (for all except QC). </p>

<li class="code-num mrgn-lft-md"><details><summary>Your employee is <strong>at least 65</strong>, but <strong>under 70</strong>, and gives you a completed Form CPT30 to <strong>restart</strong> <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions</summary>
<div id="ajax-form2"> 
<p>Your employee can elect to restart contributing to <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> if they meet all of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee filed a Form CPT30 with an employer in a prior year  </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee is receiving or will receive pensionable earnings that require <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions </li>
</ul>
<p>An employee cannot elect to start contributing again to the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> in the same calendar year in which he or she made an election to stop contributing to the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>.  </p>

<h4>When is the election considered made</h4>
<p>The election is considered to have been made when your employee gives you a copy of the completed and signed Form CPT30. </p>
<h4>When to restart <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions</h4>
<p>If your employee meets all of the above conditions and gives you a signed Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt30.html">CPT30 Election to Stop Contributing to the Canada Pension Plan, or Revocation of a Prior Election</a> with parts A, B and D completed, you must restart deducting CPP contributions on the first pay in the month following the month your employee has given you the signed copy of this form. </p>
<p>For example, if Form CPT30 is signed on March 20, 20X5, and they give it to you on the next day, the election is effective as of April 1, 20X5.</p>

<p>If Form CPT30 is dated in the past and was either provided to a different employer or or your employee providing it to you was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, the form can be accepted. However, the form must reflect the actual date it was completed, backdating is not permitted.</p>

<p>Make sure to keep a copy of all completed CPT30 forms with your payroll records.  </p>

<h4>How to prorate</h4>
<p>When prorating, use the number of months after the month in which your employee gives you Form CPT30.</p>

<h5>What if you under deducted <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions</h5>
<p>If you did not deduct <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions from your employee after the effective date of the election, you are responsible for remitting the balance due for both your employee and your share of <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions.</p>

<h4>What if your employee forgot to give you a copy of Form CPT30</h4>
<p>If your employee forgot to provide you a copy of the CPT30 revoking their election, your employee can choose to pay both your employee and your share of <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions by completing <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt20.html">Form CPT20, Election to Pay Canada Pension Plan Contributions</a> and filing it with their personal income tax and benefit return. </p>


<h4>What if the worker is self-employed</h4>

<h3>First Nations workers who are self-employed</h3>
<p>If you are a self-employed First Nations worker exempt from tax, you can elect to pay <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> on your tax-exempt self-employment income by filing out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt20.html">Form CPT20, Election to Pay Canada Pension Plan Contributions</a> when filing your personal income tax return.</p>
   
<h2 id="h_10">What is the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> enhancement</h2>
<p>From 2003 to 2018, employees were making a contribution of 4.95% on their pensionable earnings up to their annual maximum pensionable earnings (first ceiling), with employers making an equal contribution. These are the <strong>base contributions </strong>to the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>. </p>
<p>From 2019 to 2023, the contribution rate for employees was increased gradually from 4.95% to 5.95%. These are the base contributions (4.95%) and the <strong>first additional contribution</strong> to the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> (1%).</p>
<p>In 2024, an additional maximum pensionable earnings (second higher ceiling) was introduced. Employees and employers are required to make a <strong>second additional CPP contribution (CPP2)</strong> on these earnings, beginning at the first earnings ceiling and going up to the second earnings ceiling, at a rate of 4.0%. </p>
