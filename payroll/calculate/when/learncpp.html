     <h2 id="h_1">What are CPP pensionable earnings</h2>
 <p>Pensionable earnings are the employee's remuneration from pensionable office or employment with certain exceptions.</p>

            <p>Generally, you must deduct CPP contributions from:</p>
            <ul>
               <li> Salary, wages or other remuneration </li>
               <li> Commissions </li>
               <li> Bonuses </li>
               <li> Most taxable benefits </li>
               <li> Honorariums </li>
               <li> Certain tips and gratuities </li>
            </ul>
<p>To determine if you need to deduct CPP contributions based on your situation, refer to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/benefit/index.html">Determine if a benefit is taxable</a> </li>
<li><a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/payment/index.html">Determine the tax treatment of payments other than regular employment income</a> </li>
</ul>

 <h2 id="h_2">When to deduct CPP contributions</h2>
            <p>You have to deduct CPP contributions from your employee's pensionable earnings if the employee meets <strong>all </strong>of the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
               <li> Employee is in pensionable employment during the year </li>
               <li> Employee is <strong>not </strong>considered to be disabled under the CPP or the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) </li>
               <li> Employee is <strong>18 to 64</strong> years old even if the employee is receiving a CPP or QPP retirement pension </li>
               <li> Employee is <strong>65 to 69</strong> years old even if the employee is receiving a CPP or QPP retirement pension and has <strong>not</strong> completed a CPT30 election</li>
                        </ul>
            
 
<p>You <strong>must also contribute an amount equal</strong> to the CPP contributions that you deduct from your employees' remuneration and remit the total amount. Even if the required deductions were not made, you are <strong>deemed </strong>to have made them and the deductions not being made may result in a PIER review. </p>
<p>For current employees, <strong>stop</strong> deducting CPP when the employee <strong>reaches the maximum contribution</strong> for the year in their <strong>employment with you</strong>.</p>

 <h3 id="h_3_3">Special situations</h3>
 <div id="ajax-stopcpp">
           
            <p>You have to prorate the maximum CPP contribution in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Employee turns 18 in the year </li>
               <li>Employee turns 70 in the year </li>
               <li>Employee gives you a completed Form CPT30 during the year</li>
               <li>Employee is considered to be disabled under the CPP in the year</li>
               <li>Employee dies in the year </li>

 </div>
 

           
<h2 id="h_4">What if the employee has different jobs</h2>
<p>The CPP annual maximum pensionable earnings apply to <strong>each job </strong>the employee holds with <strong>different employers </strong>(different business numbers). </p>
<h3 id="h_0_1">Multiple employers</h3>
<p>If an employee leaves one employer during the year to start work with another employer, the new employer also has to deduct CPP contributions without taking into account what the previous employer paid. This is the case even if the employee has contributed the maximum amount during the previous employment.</p>
<p>Any overpayments will be refunded to employees when they file their income tax and benefit returns. You <strong>are not </strong>entitled to a refund for the employer's share of the contributions.</p>

<h3 id="h_0_2">Employer restructuring</h3>
<p>Where there was an employer restructuring, the successor employer may consider the amounts of CPP deducted, remitted or paid by the former employer for the employment of the employees for the year as if they had been deducted, remitted, or paid by the successor employer. </p>

 <h2 id="h_7">What to do if you have a business in Quebec</h2>
            <p>If you have employees whose province of employment is Quebec, you have to deduct Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions instead of CPP contributions.</p>
            <p>Learn more: <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/source-deductions-and-employer-contributions/calculating-source-deductions-and-employer-contributions/quebec-pension-plan-contributions/">Québec Pension Plan Contributions | Revenu Québec</a></p>
    
        <h3>What to do if you transfer an employee betwee Quebec and another province or territory</h3>
            <p>You may have a place of business in Quebec and in another province or territory. If you transfer an employee from Quebec to another part of Canada before the end of the year, you must use a formula to reconcile the amounts contributed to the CPP and the QPP to make sure that enough contributions to the CPP are withheld and future benefits are not affected.</p>
            <p>If you transfer an employee from Quebec to another province or territory, you can take into account the QPP contributions you deducted from that employee throughout the year when calculating the maximum CPP contributions to deduct. In addition to deducting CPP/QPP contributions, you will also have to prepare two T4 slips. </p>
           <p>It is important that you calculate and report the proper deductions and insurable/pensionable earnings on both T4 slips.</p>
           
 <h2 id="h_8">What to do if you have a business outside Canada</h2>
<p>If you do not have a place of business in Canada, you have the option to file for CPP coverage for your employees in Canada (resident or non-resident) by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt13.html">Form CPT13, Application for an Employer Resident Outside Canada to Cover Employment in Canada Under the Canada Pension Plan</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>What to do if the employee may be subject to a foreign social security plan</strong></h3>
<p>Canada has reciprocal social security agreements with certain other countries to ensure that only one plan covers and employee, either the CPP or a foreign social security plan. To find out if a particular country has an agreement with Canada and which CPT application form to use, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/international-social-security-agreements-canada-pension-plan/what-purpose-international-social-security-agreements.html">What is the purpose of international social security agreements? - CPP/EI explained</a></p>


 <h2 id="h_9">What to do if you are self-employed</h2>
            <p>If your net self-employment income and pensionable employment income is <strong>more than $3,500</strong>, you have to contribute to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).</p>
            <p>You need to calculate the amount of CPP you have to contribute when you complete your income tax and benefit return (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-22200-deduction-cpp-qpp-contributions-on-self-employment-other-earnings.html">line 22200</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-31000-cpp-qpp-contributions-on-self-employment-other-earnings.html">line 31000</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-42100-cpp-contributions-payable-on-self-employment-other-earnings.html">line 42100</a>, and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s8.html">Schedule 8</a>).</p>

<h2 id="h_10">What is the CPP enhancement</h2>
<p>Before January 1, 2019, employees contributed 4.95% on their annual maximum pensionable earnings to the CPP, with employers making an equal contribution. These are the <strong>base contributions </strong>to the CPP. </p>
<p>From 2019 to 2023, the contribution rate for employees is being increased gradually from 4.95% to 5.95%. This is the <strong>first additional contribution </strong>to the CPP. </p>
<p>Beginning in 2024, a second higher limit (the year's additional maximum pensionable earnings) will be introduced. A <strong>second additional contribution </strong>will be made on these earnings, beginning at the first earnings ceiling and going up to the second earnings ceiling. </p>
