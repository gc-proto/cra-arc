<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <p>You have to <strong>deduct</strong> CPP contributions from your employee's pensionable earnings if your employee meets <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions:</p> 
<ul class="list-unstyled">

<h3>Employer CPP contributions</h3>
<p>You <strong>must also contribute an amount equal</strong> to the CPP contributions that you deduct from your employees' remuneration and remit the total of both amounts. Even if the required deductions were not made, you are <strong>deemed </strong>to have made them and the deductions not being made may result in a PIER. </p>

<p>To determine if you need to start, stop or restart withholding CPP contributions in special situations or to review your obligations to withhold in specific employee or employer situations, refer to: <a href="cppspecial.html">Special situations - CPP contributions</a> </p>

 <h2 id="h_3">When to stop deducting CPP contributions</h2>
<div id="ajax-stopcpp"><p>For current employees, <strong>stop</strong> deducting CPP when the employee <strong>reaches the maximum contribution</strong> for the year in their <strong>employment with you</strong>.</p>

<p id="ajax-more1">The CPP annual maximum pensionable earnings apply to <strong>each job </strong>your employee holds with <strong>different employers </strong>(different business numbers). </p>
<p id="h_0_1">If your employee leaves one employer during the year to start work with another employer, the new employer also has to deduct CPP contributions without taking into account what the previous employer paid. This is the case even if your employee has contributed the maximum amount during the previous employment.</p>
<p>Any overpayments will be refunded to employees when they file their income tax and benefit returns. You <strong>are not </strong>entitled to a refund for your share of CPP contributions.</p>

<h3>First Nations workers who are self-employed</h3>
<p>If you are a self-employed First Nations worker exempt from tax, you can elect to pay CPP on your tax-exempt self-employment income by filing out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt20.html">Form CPT20, Election to Pay Canada Pension Plan Contributions</a> when filing your personal income tax return.</p>

			 
<h2 id="h_10">What is the CPP enhancement</h2>
<p>From 2003 to 2018, employees were making a contribution of 4.95% on their pensionable earnings up to their annual maximum pensionable earnings (first ceiling), with employers making an equal contribution. These are the <strong>base contributions </strong>to the CPP. </p>
<p>From 2019 to 2023, the contribution rate for employees was increased gradually from 4.95% to 5.95%. These are the base contributions (4.95%) and the <strong>first additional contribution</strong> to the CPP (1%).</p>
<p>In 2024, an additional maximum pensionable earnings (second higher ceiling) was introduced. Employees and employers are required to make a <strong>second additional CPP contribution (CPP2)</strong> on these earnings, beginning at the first earnings ceiling and going up to the second earnings ceiling, at a rate of 4.0%. </p>

			 

		 
			 <h2 id="h_7">What to do if you have employees whose province of employment is Quebec</h2>
<p>If you have employees whose province of employment is Quebec, regardless of your employee's province or territory of residence, you have to deduct Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions instead of CPP contributions.</p>

<details><summary>What to do if you <strong>transfer an employee between Quebec and another province or territory</strong></summary><p>You may have a place of business in Quebec and in another province or territory. If you transfer an employee from Quebec to another province or territory, you can take into account the QPP contributions you deducted from that employee throughout the year when calculating the maximum CPP contributions to deduct.</p>
<p>If you do this <strong>before the end of the year</strong>, you must use a formula to reconcile the amounts contributed to the CPP and QPP to make sure that enough contributions to the CPP are withheld and future benefits are not affected.</p>

<h3>How to report on T4 slips</h3>
<p>In addition to deducting CPP/QPP contributions, you will also have to prepare <strong>two T4 slips</strong>.</p>
<p>It is important that you calculate and report the proper deductions and insurable/pensionable earnings on <strong>both</strong> <span class="nowrap">T4 slips</span>.</p>

			 <h2 id="h_7a"><a id="h_7a"></a>What to do if you have First Nations employees</h2>
<p>The employment income of a First Nations employee which is exempt from income tax is not subject to CPP contributions. If their employment income is not tax exempt, it will be subject to CPP deductions.</p>
<h3>How to apply for CPP coverage</h3>

	<h2 id="h_7b">What to do if you have employees outside Canada</h2>
<p>If you are a Canadian employer and if you have employees working outside Canada, you must deduct CPP contributions if <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee usually reports for work at your place of business in Canada</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee is a Canadian resident and is paid from your place of business in Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even if the employment does <strong>not</strong> meet the above conditions, international social security agreements may require the employment to be pensionable.</p>

<div id="ajax-cpp-outside2"><p>You may have the option to extend CPP coverage to your employees or your employee may have the option to file for CPP coverage if they meet the conditions to make the employment pensionable.</p>
