                  <summary>Calculation example</summary>
                  <p>David is paid weekly (52 pay periods per year). The remuneration that requires tax deductions will be his gross weekly remuneration minus the weekly deductions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate the gross weekly remuneration</strong><br />His gross weekly remuneration are equal to his basic weekly salary of $500 <strong>plus </strong>his taxable benefits of $50.00. The total is $550.00.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 2: Calculate the weekly deductions</strong><br />The weekly deductions are equal to his RPP contributions of $25.00 <strong>plus </strong>union dues deductions of $5.50 <strong>plus </strong>his deduction for living in a prescribed zone of $77.00 ($11.00 per day × 7 days). The total weekly deductions amount is $107.50.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 3: Calculate the weekly net remuneration on which you have to deduct income tax</strong><br />Subtract the weekly deductions amount you calculated in <strong>step 2 </strong>from the gross weekly remuneration in <strong>step 1</strong>. The result will be the net weekly remuneration on which you have to deduct income tax.<br />The gross weekly remuneration of $550 <strong>minus </strong>the total weekly deductions of $107.50 <strong>equals </strong>the remuneration that requires tax deductions at source of $442.50.</p>

<h2 id="h_11">What to do if your employee or you requested to reduce the income tax</h2>
<p>If your <strong>employee </strong>received a letter of authority (tax waiver) to reduce tax deductions at source, you need to reduce by the amount specified in the letter of authority.</p>
<p>If you received the blanket waiver letter  and <strong>completed </strong>declaration of intent forms, you need to reduce the lump sum payment by the amount on the declaration of intent in order to calculate the <strong>taxable </strong>amount of the lump sum payment.</p>
