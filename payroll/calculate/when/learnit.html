<h2 id="h_1">What are taxable earnings</h2>
<p>As an employer or a payer, you are required to deduct federal and provincial or territorial income tax from remuneration and other income that you pay. </p>
<p>You need to determine which provincial or territorial income tax you are required to deduct based on the <strong>province of employment of the employee</strong>. </p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/employee/poe.html">Determine the province of employment (POE)</a></p>

<p>Generally, you have to deduct income tax from:</p>
<div id="ajax-deduct">
           
  <ul class="fa-ul">
	      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Salary, wages, commissions or other remuneration including taxable benefits </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Honorariums from employment or office, director's fees, management fees, fees paid to board or committee members and executor's, liquidator's, or administrator's fees earned to administer an estate (as long as the executor, liquidator, or administrator <strong>does not act in this capacity </strong>in the regular course of business). </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Bonuses/retroactive pay increases and vacation pay. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Wages in lieu of termination notice. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Remuneration paid while the employee is on vacation, furlough, sabbatical, or sick leave, or for lost-time pay from a union, vacation pay, benefits paid under a supplementary unemployment benefit plan to a trustee for payment of periodic amounts to employees who are laid off for any temporary or indefinite period  (such as employer paid maternity and parental top-up amounts) and payments for sick leave credits and accrued vacation. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Wage-loss replacement plans benefits. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Tips and gratuities:
<ul>
<li>Tips and gratuities that are <strong>controlled</strong> by you and received from the performance of services are considered income from employment. </li>
<li>In the <strong>province of Quebec, declared tips</strong> required to be reported by employees in the restaurant, bar or hotel sectors to their employers.</li></ul></li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> <strong>Additional </strong>amounts that <strong>you pay </strong>while participating in a job creation project that Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) has approved. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Remuneration paid to a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of perpetual poverty, unless you pay the remuneration to the order or the employee gives you a letter of authority. </li>

</ul>

<h2 id="h_2">When to deduct income tax</h2>
<p>You are responsible for deducting income tax from the remuneration or other income you pay to your employees.</p>
<p>Income tax deductions:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and ">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">start to be deducted from the first dollar earned </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">have <strong>no age limit</strong> for deducting them </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">have no maximum deduction amount or maximum earnings for deductions to be taken from</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">have no employer contribution </li>
</ul>
<p>To determine how much income tax to deduct, you may need the following to determine the employee's income tax deductions, including the basic personal amount:</p>

  <ul class="fa-ul">
	      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Federal form - TD1: To be filled out by individuals that have a new employer or payer, or want to change amounts from previous amounts claimed, or want to claim the deduction for living in a prescribed zone or want to increase income tax deductions </li>

            <div id="ajax-it">
              
               <p>You need to <strong>subtract</strong> the following deductions from remuneration when calculating tax deductions:</p>

               <details>
                  <summary>Calculation example</summary>
                  <p>David is paid weekly (52 pay periods per year). The remuneration that requires tax deductions will be his gross weekly remuneration minus the weekly deductions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate the gross weekly remuneration</strong><br />His gross weekly remuneration is equal to his basic weekly salary of $500 <strong>plus </strong>his taxable benefits of $50.00. The total is $550.00.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 2: Calculate the weekly deductions</strong><br />The weekly deductions are equal to his RPP contributions of $25.00 <strong>plus </strong>union dues deductions of $5.50 <strong>plus </strong>his deduction for living in a prescribed zone of $77.00 ($11.00 per day × 7 days). The total weekly deductions amount is $107.50.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 3: Calculate the weekly net remuneration on which you have to deduct income tax</strong><br />Subtract the weekly deductions amount you calculated in <strong>step 2 </strong>from the gross weekly remuneration in <strong>step 1</strong>. The result will be the net weekly remuneration on which you have to deduct income tax.<br />The gross weekly remuneration of $550 <strong>minus </strong>the total weekly deductions of $107.50 <strong>equals </strong>the remuneration that requires tax deductions at source of $442.50.</p>
               </details>
            </div>
<h2 id="h_6">What if the employee has different jobs</h2>
<p>Each employer must deduct income tax from the remuneration or other income they have paid to their employees regardless of whether they have other employers in the year. If the employee has already claimed personal tax credit amounts in the year on Form TD1 with another employer, they cannot claim them again when starting employment with you.</p>

      
<h2 id="h_9">What to do if you have employees whose province of employment is Quebec</h2>
<p>If you pay your employee remuneration or other income and their province of employment is Quebec, as well as deducting federal income tax, you will also have to deduct Quebec provincial income tax and remit the provincial tax to Revenu Quebec. </p>

 <h2 id="h_7b">What to do if you have employees outside Canada</h2>
<div id="ajax-it-outside">
<p>If you have Canadian resident employees working outside Canada, you generally have to deduct income tax. </p>

<p>Your employee may be entitled to a foreign tax credit in Canada for income taxes paid in the foreign country by requesting a letter of authority to reduce their deductions of Canadian income tax.</p>

</div> 

<h2 id="h_10">What to do if your employee requested to increase income tax deductions</h2>
<p>If your employee filled out a <strong>TD1 form requesting an increase to income tax deductions</strong>, you need to increase the income tax deduction from each payment by the amount requested on the form.</p>

<h2 id="h_11">What to do if your employee requested to reduce the income tax deducted</h2>
<p>If your <strong>employee </strong>received a letter of authority (tax waiver) to reduce tax deductions at source, you need to reduce the income tax deduction by the amount specified in the letter of authority.</p>
<p>If you received the blanket waiver letter  and <strong>completed </strong>declaration of intent forms, you need to reduce the lump sum payment by the amount on the declaration of intent in order to calculate the <strong>taxable </strong>amount of the lump sum payment.</p>
