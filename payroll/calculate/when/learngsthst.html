<h2 id="h_1">How GST/HST applies to benefits</h2>
<p>GST/HST does not apply to:</p>

  <ul class="fa-ul">
	      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Salaries and wages </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Commissions </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Gratuities </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Other cash remuneration you pay to employees </li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the GST/HST applies to an employee benefit or non-cash compensation (also called a fringe or employee taxable benefit) is largely based on whether the employee's benefit is taxable under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>Generally, if an employee benefit is taxable for income tax purposes, you are also considered to have made a supply of the property or service to your employee. If GST/HST applies to that property or service, you are considered to have collected the GST/HST on the benefit. </p>
<p>However, there are situations where you will not be considered to have collected the GST/HST on a taxable employee benefit.</p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>You bought a passenger vehicle from a <strong>non-registrant</strong> and made it available to your employee throughout 2022. The passenger vehicle is used more than 90% in the commercial activities of your business. You report the value of the benefit, including the GST/HST and if applicable, the PST, on the employee's T4 slip. For GST/HST purposes, you will be considered to have collected the GST/HST on this benefit even if you could not claim an ITC on the purchase of the passenger vehicle.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Property acquired <strong>before 1991</strong> or from a <strong>non-registrant</strong></summary>
<p>If you acquired property before 1991, you did not pay the GST/HST. Also, you do not generally pay the GST/HST when you acquire property from a non-registrant. As a result, you cannot claim an ITC under these circumstances. However, if you make this property available to your employee and the benefit is taxable for income tax purposes, you may still be considered to have collected the GST/HST on this benefit.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="h_2">Determine if you have to remit GST/HST on benefits</h2>
<p id="gst">You have to remit GST/HST if it is considered to be collected on the taxable benefit.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: GST/HST not considered collected</summary>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 class="text-muted">Employee benefits</h4> <p><strong>Last day in February</strong> of the year after the year you provided the benefit (this is also the deadline for distributing T4 slips to your employees)</p></li>

<p>You are considered to have collected the GST/HST on those taxable benefits on February 28, 2023. You have to report the GST/HST for those taxable benefits on your GST/HST return for the reporting period that includes the last day of February 2023, using line 105 (or line 103 if you are filing by paper).</p>
</details>
</div>

<h2 id="h_4">Can you claim input tax credits (ITCs) on benefits</h2>
<div id="ajax-itcno">
<p>As a GST/HST registrant, you can claim an ITC to recover the GST/HST paid or payable on the purchases and operating expenses related to your commercial activities. Generally, commercial activities include the making of supplies of taxable property and services. </p>
<p><strong>For employee benefits</strong>, you can usually claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable on property and services you supply to your employees or their relatives as a benefit if it is related to your commercial activities.</p>
<h3>ITC restrictions</h3>
<p>In some situations, you will not be able to claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable for property or services that give rise to taxable benefits you provide your employees.</p>
<p>If you cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable for property or services that give rise to a taxable benefit due to the restrictions described in one of the following paragraphs, you are not considered to have collected the GST/HST. You do not have to remit the GST/HST on that benefit.</p>
<details><summary> Club memberships</summary>
<p>You may pay or reimburse fees for membership to any club whose main purpose is to provide dining, recreational, or sporting facilities. In such cases, you cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable, regardless of whether the club membership fees or dues are a taxable benefit for the employee for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>However, you can claim ITCs for the GST/HST paid or payable on such memberships if you acquire the memberships exclusively for supply in the ordinary course of a business of supplying them.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Exclusive personal use</summary>
<p>You cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable on property or services you acquire, import, or bring into a participating province for the exclusive personal consumption, use, or enjoyment (90% or more) of an employee or an employee's relative.</p>
<p>However, you can claim an ITC in the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The consumption, use, or enjoyment of the property or service by the employee or their relative does not give rise to a taxable benefit for income tax purposes and no amounts were payable by the employee for this benefit. The most common type of non-taxable benefit is the paying of moving expenses by an employer. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">During the same GST/HST reporting period, you make a supply of the property or service to an employee or their relative for consideration that becomes due in that period and that is equal to its fair market value </li>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Property supplied by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement</summary>
<p>You cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable on property supplied by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement that is more than 50% for the personal consumption, use, or enjoyment of one of the following:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are <strong>an individual</strong>, yourself or another individual related to you </li>

<h2 id="h_5">What to do if you have employees whose province of employment is Quebec</h2>
<p>In Quebec, Revenu Québec administers the GST/HST unless you are a person that is a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) for GST/HST or QST purposes or both. </p>
<p>If you pay your employee remuneration or other income and their province of employment is Quebec, as well as deducting federal income tax, you will have to remit the GST/HST to Revenu Quebec.</p>
