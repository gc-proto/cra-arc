<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
<li><h3 id="step1"> Determine if the CRA has garnished your employee’s salary or wages</h3>
<p>If you received a <strong>requirement to pay notice</strong> and you are required to send the amount owed to the CRA from the net pay (employment income after withholding source deductions) instead of paying it to your employee, this means that the CRA has garnished your employee’s salary or wages. </p>

</li>
	
<li><h3 id="step2"> Determine if you need to report the payment on a T4 slip</h3>
<p>You must report the payment as employment income on your employee’s T4 slip in the <strong>year the salary and wages are received</strong>.</p>
</li>
	
<li><h3 id="step3">Withhold payroll deductions </h3>
<p>You must withhold the following payroll deductions from the salary and wages of your employee who is subject to a garnishment:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg"> 
 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li  text-success"> </span> Income tax</li>

	<p><span class="fas fa-calculator fa-xl text-muted"></span> Learn more: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/how/index.html">How to calculate</a></p>		
 </li>

<li><h3 id="step4">Remit the garnished amounts to the CRA </h3>
<p>From the net pay of the employee, you are responsible to remit all amounts all amounts as specified in the requirement to pay notice. If you do not comply with these requirements, you may be held responsible for amounts you didn’t remit. Even if your employee tells you they have made arrangements with CRA, you must comply with the garnishment unless we tell you in writing that it has been withdrawn. </p>
<p>If you need more information, you can contact the CRA collections officer assigned to the case using the phone number on the letter.</p>
<details><summary>When to contact the CRA</summary>	
 <p>You must contact the CRA collections officer immediately if any of the following situations apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You cease to periodically pay your employee the amount from which you deduct employment income.</li>
	<li>The amounts you deduct are already subject to garnishment.</li>
	<li>After receiving a deduction notice respecting an employee employment income, you are informed that the amounts you remit to the CRA have become subject to garnishment.</li>
	<li>The frequency of payments you make to your employee changes.</li>
	<li>The employment income specified in the deduction notice is greater than the seizable portion of the income you periodically pay your employee for employment income. In such a situation, do not modify the deduction yourself. Contact us, and we will send you a modified deduction notice if necessary.</li>
	<li>You remitted an amount in error to us.</li>
	<li>The legal form of your business changes after the deduction notice is issued (for example, your business is sold or incorporated, or it merges with another business).</li>
	<li>Your business closes.</li>
	<li>Your business number (BN) changes.</li>
	<li>Your business's name or address changes.</li>
	<li>Your business has a new contact person.</li>
	<li>You receive a notice from a trustee in bankruptcy requiring you to cease all deductions from the amount you periodically pay employment income to your employee.</li>
	<li>You change how you make your remittances and are no longer using remittance slips.</li>
</ul>
</details>	
	
<details><summary>What if you do not withhold and remit the deduction amount</summary>		
<p>If you fail to deduct the amount on the deduction notice and remit it to the CRA (or if you refuse to do so), you become jointly liable with the payer of support for the support owed.</p>
<p>The CRA may then undertake collection measures against you, as provided for by the Act, in order to recover the amounts that must be deducted and remitted.</p>
<p>The CRA will also apply a penalty and charge interest.</p>
