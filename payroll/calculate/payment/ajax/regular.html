<details><summary>Factors to consider to determine if the employee is regularly employed</summary>
<p>To determine whether or not the employee is regularly employed, the following factors may be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed pattern rather than a fixed period of employment</li>
<li>The regularity of the work schedule</li>
<li>The employment need not be long-term</li>
<li>The employment can be only temporary so long as it is regular</li>
<li>The work schedule does not necessarily have to be determined in advance or remain fixed in time; however, it must be possible to identify some consistency in the frequency and the sequence of units of work which the employee is called on to provide</li>
</ul>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger fa-lg"></span> Not regularly employed  </h4>
<p>Grace works occasionally or as required either on a temporary or long-term basis to cover for regular workers who are unavailable. </p> 
<p> She would be considered to be not regularly employed because there is no fixed pattern of employment, no regularity to the work schedule, and no consistency in the frequency and sequence of units of work which the worker is called on to provide. </p> 
<p> Grace's employment may be described as casual, intermittent, sporadic, or employed to an inconsiderable extent or hardly at all.</p> 
</li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg text-success"></span> Regularly employed  </h4>
<p>Marc works two days a week or a particular shift each day. </p> 
<p> Regardless of whether his employment is temporary (for the duration of a particular rescue operation) or long-term (for more than one or a series of rescue operations), he would be considered to be regularly employed. </p> 
<p> This is because there is an identifiable fixed pattern of employment, a continuity and regularity to the work schedule, and there is a consistency in the frequency and sequence of units of work which he is called on to provide.   </p> 
</li>
</ul>
