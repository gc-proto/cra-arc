<details><summary>Factors to consider to determine if the employee is regularly employed</summary>
<p>To determine whether or not the employee is regularly employed, the following factors may be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed pattern rather than a fixed period of employment</li>
<li>The regularity of the work schedule</li>
<li>The employment need not be long-term</li>
<li>The employment can be only temporary so long as it is regular</li>
<li>The work schedule does not necessarily have to be determined in advance or remain fixed in time; however, it must be possible to identify some consistency in the frequency and the sequence of units of work which the employee is called on to provide</li>
</ul>
