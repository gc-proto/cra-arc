<p>You may provide research grants or post-doctoral fellowship income to a recipient. Generally, you will report these amounts on a T4A slip.</p>

<details><summary>What is a research grant or a post-doctoral fellowship</summary>
<h4 id="research">Research grants</h4>
<p>Research grants are sums of money provided to an individual for the payment of expenses necessary to conduct a research project. The grant may include personal or living expenses. The grant may also include an element of remuneration to the recipient.  Funds originating from various sources may be paid to and administered by a college, university, hospital, or similar institution where the researcher is employed. However, only that part of the grant paid to, or otherwise available for, the researcher is considered to be a research grant.</p>
<h4>Post-doctoral fellowship</h4>
<p>The term post-doctoral fellowship is not defined in the Income Tax Act. The term is used (as in post-doctoral fellow or PDF) to indicate an individual who has recently obtained his or her Ph.D. (usually within the past five years or possibly longer) who is engaged in advanced research activities at a university or at a facility or laboratory connected with a university. The aim of the individual is often to obtain sufficient experience and published research as a PDF to be considered for a position as a professor at a university (an Academic PDF).</p>
<p>The term is used, usually on its own, to refer to an individual who has completed both the required academic and professional training in a particular field (for example, a medical doctor), and who has been given a special grant to enable him or her to engage in specialized training or research. In the field of medicine, such fellows often receive the grant to work in a highly specialized area requiring clinical duties as a medical doctor within a hospital setting (a Clinical Fellow).<p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p> For the purposes of paragraph 56(1)(o) of the Income Tax Act, research involves a critical or scientific inquiry aimed at the discovery of new facts, or the development of new interpretations or applications. In order for a payment to be considered a research grant, the terms of the payment must establish that its primary purpose is to enable the recipient to carry out research.</p>

<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
 <li> <h3 id="step1">Determine if the research grants or post-doctoral fellowship income are considered employment income</h3>
<p> If you provide research grants or post-doctoral fellowship income, your withholding and reporting obligations will depend on whether the payments are considered employment income.</p>
<h4>Situations</h4>
<details><summary>Situation: Research grants</summary>
<p>If you only pay a research grant to a recipient, the grant is not considered employment income.</p>
<p>If you pay a research grant to an employee whose duties of employment do not include research responsibilities, the grant will generally not be considered employment income. However, the salary and wages you pay to your employee will be reported on a T4 slip and you are required to withhold CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions. </p>
<p>Where your employee’s duties of employment include research responsibilities, they cannot treat a portion of their regular salary as a research grant when they engage in the type of research work ordinarily expected of them under their terms of employment.</p>

</details>
	 
<details><summary>Situation: Post-doctoral fellowship income</summary>
<p>You must determine if your contract with the post-doctoral fellow (PDF) is an employment contract or an agreement of financial assistance regarding continuing studies.</p>
<p>Employment status has direct impacts on your reporting and withholding requirements for the worker under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Employment Insurance Act (EIA) and the Income Tax Act (ITA).<p>
<p>You need to consider multiple factors to determine if the contract is an employment contract or not. You can use the CRA guidance to help you gather the facts based on your situation.<p>
