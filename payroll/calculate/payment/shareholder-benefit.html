<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Determine if the benefit is considered a shareholder benefit</h1>

    <p>To determine if the benefit is a shareholder benefit, all of the facts relevant to the situation must be considered to determine if the benefit was received from the corporation in the shareholder’s capacity as a shareholder or as an employee. </p>

<p><strong>This determination must be done based on a thorough review of the facts in each specific case.</strong> Each benefit you provide to your shareholder must be reviewed separately of any other benefit that they received. There is no one factor that is determinative, and there is a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider.</p>

	<p>The following are types of shareholder benefits:</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li><strong>Personal use of company property:</strong> Personal use of company assets like cars, homes, or boats is a taxable benefit.</li> 
		<li><strong>Loans to shareholders:</strong> Low or no-interest loans to shareholders can result in taxable benefits.</li> 
		<li><strong>Forgiven or low-interest loans:</strong> Loans that are forgiven or not required to be repaid are shareholder benefits.</li> 
		<li><strong>Dividends in lieu of salary:</strong> Dividends paid instead of salary to avoid taxes can be a taxable shareholder benefit.</li> 
		<li><strong>Benefits to family members:</strong> If benefits are given to family members of shareholders, they are also considered taxable.</li> 
		<li><strong>Personal expenses paid by the company:</strong> If the company pays personal expenses on behalf of shareholders, it is considered a benefit.</li> 
		<li><strong>Below-market rent:</strong> Rent charged below fair market value is considered a shareholder benefit.</li> </ul>

    <h3 id="analyze">Analyze the facts</h3>
    <p>You need to analyze the facts by organizing and assessing the information you gathered.</p>

    <h3 id="weight">Weighing the facts</h3>
   <p>This is the most important part of analyzing the information. When reviewing the factors, there may be some facts that support the benefit was received from the corporation in the shareholder’s capacity as a shareholder and other facts indicate an employee.</p>

    <p>To help you resolve this issue, you must determine the true essence of the relationship of the parties, comparing the intentions of the parties to the facts of the relationship. You must review the indicators in the factors of control, ownership of tools and equipment, opportunity for profit and financial risk, and responsibility for investment and management. As you review each question and response, you should be able to decide what weight to assign each indicator based on a thorough review of all the responses. For example, control may favour an employee relationship, but ownership of tools may be assigned <strong>more weight </strong>due to how the total relationship is structured. This may be an indicator because of the increased weight given to this factor, that the worker is self-employed.</p>

<p>If the worker is an employee, you may need to consider additional factors to determine if the worker is an <strong>incorporated employee</strong>. </p>
<p>Special rules may apply to their corporation for income tax purposes if a worker performs the services on behalf of their own corporation. This may be considered a personal services business (PSB). </p>
