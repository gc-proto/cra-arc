<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Payments from retirement compensation arrangements (RCA)</h1>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Content has been updated for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirements. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>You may have set up a retirement compensation arrangement (RCA) for your employees for which you make contributions to a custodian. Distributions may be made by the custodian of the arrangement which must be reported on a T4A-RCA slip.</p>

<details><summary>What is an RCA</summary>
<p>A retirement compensation arrangement (RCA) is a plan or an arrangement under which an employer, former employer, and in some cases an employee makes contributions to a person or partnership, referred to as a custodian.</p>
<p>The custodian holds the funds in trust with the intent of eventually distributing them to the employee, former employee or other beneficiary on, after, or in contemplation of the following: </p>
<ul>
	<li>an employee's retirement </li>
	<li>an employee's loss of an office or employment </li>
	<li>any substantial change in the services the employee provides (for example, a senior corporate director who, after termination, is retained on a part time basis to teach a management course to new trainees may be considered to have substantially changed the services being provided for the purposes of the definition of an RCA) </li>
</ul>
<p>An employer or former employer may acquire an interest in a life insurance policy (including an annuity) to fund benefits on, after, or in contemplation of any of the situations listed above. In that case, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) would consider the interest to be the property of an RCA and the employer to be the custodian of the RCA.</p>

<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
	
<li><h3 id="step1">Determine what you need to do before making contributions to the RCA</h3>
<p>Before you make a contribution to the custodian of your RCA arrangement, you have to send <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t733.html">Form T733, Application for a Retirement Compensation Arrangement (RCA) Account Number</a>, with a signed copy of the RCA trust agreement to apply for account numbers for both you (as the employer)(RC) and for the custodian of the RCA (T).<p>
<p>These are sent to the:</p>
<p>RCA Unit</p>
<p>Winnipeg Tax Centre</p>
<p>66 Stapon Road</p>
<p>Winnipeg MB R3C 3M2</p>

</li> 

<li><h3 id="step2">Withhold refundable tax from contributions you make to the RCA</h3>
<p>If you (as the employer) make contributions to the RCA, you have to deduct a 50% refundable tax on any contributions you make to a custodian of the RCA. This refundable tax must be remitted using <strong>Form T901B, Statement of Account</strong> to your RC account number, on or before the 15th day of the month following the month you withheld it.</p>
<details><summary>Special situation: First RCA refundable tax remittance</summary>
<p>Send your first payment of refundable tax to the RCA Unit at the Winnipeg Tax Centre by cheque or money order made out to the Receiver General for Canada.</p> 
<p>If you have to remit this tax but have not received an RC employer account number, complete Form T733 and send it with your payment directly to the Winnipeg Tax Centre.</p> 
<p>After your first remittance has been processed, you will be issued Form T901B to make further remittances.</p> 
</details>
<p>If you made contributions to the custodian, you must complete T737-RCA slips and a T737 Summary to report these contributions. These do not need to be filed if you did not make any contributions during the year.</p> 
<p>You must provide two copies of the T737 slips to the custodian of the RCA. If the custodian agrees in writing, you may provide the T737 slips to them electronically.</p>

<p>If you withheld any deductible RCA contributions from your employee’s income, you must report these contributions in box 20 of your employee’s T4 slip. </p>
<details><summary>Special situation: Refunds of specified withholding tax</summary>
<p>A refund of 50% of certain retirement benefits paid may be claimed (up to the amount of specified refundable tax at the end of the taxation year) where certain conditions are met. One of the conditions requires the eligible employer to file an election with the CRA under subsection 207.71(2) of the ITA.</p> 
<p>If you have to remit this tax but have not received an RC employer account number, complete Form T733 and send it with your payment directly to the Winnipeg Tax Centre.</p>

</details>
</li>

<li><h3 id="step3">Withhold refundable tax from income earned in the RCA trust or employee contributions to the RCA</h3>
<p>You, as the custodian, are also required to remit the 50% refundable tax from any income from business or property, any capital gains earned in the RCA trust and any employee contributions which they make directly to the RCA trust.</p> 
<p>You must remit this tax using Form <strong>T901B, Statement of Account </strong>, which is available only in a personalized, pre-printed format. The CRA will issue Form T901B after it processes your first payment. </p>

</li>

<li><h3 id="step4">Determine what you need to do before making distributions out of the RCA</h3>
<p>Before you, as the custodian, make the first distribution out of the RCA trust to a beneficiary, you must apply for a remittance account number by completing <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t735.html">Form T735, Application for a Remittance Number for Tax Withheld from a Retirement Compensation Arrangement (RCA)</a> and sending it to the Winnipeg Tax Centre.</p>
<p>The CRA uses Form T735 to open two accounts:</p>	
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>RP</strong> employer remittance account, a payroll account for the RCA trust only</li>
	<li>The <strong>NR</strong> account, a non-resident deduction remittance account which begins with the letters NRQ, which is used to report payments you make to non-residents and to remit income tax withheld from those payments</li>
</ul>

 <li><h4>Withhold income tax</h4> 
<p>You, as the custodian, are required to withhold income tax on distributions you make out of the RCA trust. The calculation to use for distributions to a Canadian resident depends on if the distribution is a periodic or a lump-sum payment.</p>
<p>If you made a distribution to a non-resident, you are required to withhold tax at a rate of 25%. </p>
 </li>
<li><h4>Remit income tax withheld</h4></li>
<p>You, as the custodian, must remit the income tax you withheld on distributions to the account from step four using the following forms:
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <p>Income tax withheld from distributions to residents is remitted using the PD7A that will be issued to you (as the custodian) after your first remittance has been processed.</p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <p>Withholding tax withheld from non-residents is remitted using Form NR76 – Statement of Account that will be issued to you (as the custodian) after your first remittance has been processed.</p> </li>
				  </ul></ol></li>

<li><h3 id="step6">Report the payment on a slip</h3>
<p>You, as the custodian, must report the distributions paid to beneficiaries on a T4A-RCA slip or an NR4 slip, depending on if the recipient was a resident or a non-resident:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Canadian resident - T4A-RCA slip</h4>
 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg">
