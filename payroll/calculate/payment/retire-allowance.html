<p>If you provide a retiring allowance (severance pay) to your employee, you have to report the payment and deductions on a T4 slip. Depending whether the recipient is a Canadian resident or a non-resident of Canada, your income tax withholding and reporting will be different.</p>

<li> 
<h3 id="step2">Determine if the retiring allowance is considered damages </h3>
<p>You need to determine if the retiring allowance is considered damages. This is because damages may be included or excluded from retiring allowances.</p>
<details><summary>What is considered damages</summary>
<p>Amounts paid on account of damages to an employee or former employee (for example, a payment made under a grievance settlement, arbitration decision or court order) could be considered one or more of the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Employment income</li>
  <li>Retiring allowance</li>
  <li>Non-taxable damages</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Determining the tax treatment of the damages requires a review of all relevant facts. For example, if a human rights tribunal awards an individual an amount for general damages, the amount is normally considered non-taxable damages and is not required to be included in income.</p>

<p>Generally, a lump-sum payment is included in income in the year the recipient receives it. This may result in a greater tax liability than if the payment had been

<p>A special tax calculation is available to recipients who receive a <abbr title="Qualifying retroactive lump-sum payment">QRLSP</abbr> that relate to any year after 1977. The calculation applies if the total of all principal

<p>You (as the payer) must provide to the recipient <strong>one</strong> of the following to help the CRA decide if the special tax calculation is beneficial to them:</p>
