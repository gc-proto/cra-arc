<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Payer</h4>
<p>The <strong>payer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires the truck driver to accept all loads and trips assigned to them</li>
<li>Requires the truck driver to follow specific routes</li>
<li>Requires the driver to report daily and explain any delays or downtime regardless of their ability to meet the deadline assigned</li>
<li>Requires the truck driver to get approval before taking certain actions (for example, where to take the truck for repairs if it breaks down while on the road)</li>
<li>Controls where the truck is to be parked when not in use</li>
<li>May subject the driver to a fuel efficiency program and impose corrective measures on the driver</li>
<li>May take disciplinary actions against the truck driver if, for example, they report to work late or do not follow the policies and procedures regarding freight handling</li>
<li>Pays for the truck driver’s cost of training or certifications required by law, such as how to use air brakes, the transportation of dangerous goods, border crossing, and driving a road train</li>
<li>Resolves customer complaints</li>
<li>Decides the truck driver’s pay rate and how it will be calculated (hourly, by mile or kilometre, by lump sum for certain routes, or by percentage of payload)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Pays overtime to the driver when required</li>
<li>Pays the truck driver for downtime associated with truck repairs, border crossings, etc.</li>
<li>Provides benefits to the truck driver such as:<ul>
<li>Paid vacation</li>
<li>Sick days</li>
<li>Short-term and long-term disability coverage</li>
<li>Medical or dental insurance</li>
<li>A pension plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requires that the truck driver ask permission to be absent from work</li>
<li>Provides all tools, including the truck and communication devices, and does not charge the truck driver a fee to use them</li>
<li>Pays for all the operating expenses, such as fuel, oil, maintenance, insurance, and repairs</li>
<li>Normally arranges for a replacement if the truck driver is unable to work; the truck driver does not normally hire and send their own replacement</li>
<li>Pays premiums for workers’ compensation on behalf of the driver</li>
<li>Does not allow the driver to keep earnings from backhaul loads (these are loads of freight that allow a truck driver to return to their home base with a loaded truck, rather than an empty one)</li>
<li>Pays or reimburses the truck driver for any helpers needed to load or unload the cargo</li>
<li>Reimburses the truck driver for any expenses relating to the services they performed for the payer’s business</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Payer</h4>
<p>The <strong>truck driver</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>May not seek or accept any additional cargo from other shippers without the payer’s approval</li>
<li>Does not have a <a href="#business_presence">business presence</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the above indicators may be considered to be <a href="#neutral_or_inconclusive">neutral or unclear</a> when they are present because of the type of work, for example, for safety issues.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Example of an employee&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The payer, Company B, is a long-distance trucking company providing hauling services to a third party, XYZ Logging. Company B owns the truck the worker drives and pays for all operating expenses. It requires the truck driver to work a regular five-day work schedule and pays the driver hourly. The driver has to stay in frequent contact with XYZ Logging’s dispatcher and may be asked to use specific routes. The payer resolves any complaints it receives from XYZ Logging and may discipline the truck driver. The driver has to ask permission to be absent from work, and the payer chooses the replacement driver and pays their wages. The driver has to purchase gas at stations where the payer has accounts. The payer does not charge the driver a fee for using the <span class="nowrap">on-board</span> communication devices. As well, the payer pays premiums on the worker’s behalf for worker’s compensation insurance. These facts support that the worker is an employee. When looking at the total relationship of everyone involved, it is reasonable to conclude that the payer monitors, directs, or controls or has the right to monitor, direct, or control how the worker does the work, whether the payer exercises this right or not.</p>

</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>A self-employed worker</h4>
<details><summary>Indicators that the worker is self-employed</summary>
<p>The following indicators can help you determine if a truck driver is <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span>. This is not a complete list, and not all of these indicators will be present in every situation. Consider all facts related to the working relationship.</p>
<h3>Indicators that the worker is <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span></h3>
<p>Generally, a truck driver is considered to be <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> if the employee indicators <a href="#indicators_that_the">listed above</a> are not present and the truck driver:</p>
<ul>
<li>negotiates their rate of pay when the contract is signed and when it is renewed</li>
<li>can pick and choose the loads or trips available</li>
<li>can choose the route they want</li>
<li>does not have to report or call the payer during a trip</li>
<li>can hire a replacement driver at their own discretion and pays their wages</li>
<li>may accept passengers at their own discretion</li>
<li>is the sole owner of the truck on the ownership document</li>
<li>has full control of the truck under a lease arrangement and can use the truck as they see fit</li>

<h2 class="h4">Example of a <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> worker</h2>
<p>Mrs. C owns her own truck and pays for all operating expenses related to its use, such as licences, fuel, oil, <span class="nowrap">on-board</span> communication system, repairs, maintenance, and insurance. She has a business presence and advertises her services in local papers and online. She is carrying on work for various payers according to her availability. Company Z, one of her clients, requires her services regularly for hauling woodchips. She negotiated a flat rate of <span class="nowrap">$1,000.00</span> for each trip she accepts and charges GST. She invoices Company Z and is paid only when the work is completed. She can hire helpers or other drivers to operate her truck and she is responsible to pay for their wages. She pays for her own traffic or transport infractions. These facts could be considered to support the conclusion of a <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> worker if the type of work dictates that these working conditions are necessary and that when looking at the total relationship of the everyone involved, it is clear that the payer does not monitor, direct, control, or have the right to monitor, direct, or control how the truck driver does the work. The worker is not integrated into the operating framework of the payer’s business.</p>
<h2>Can a truck driver be classified as an employee and a <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> worker?</h2>
<p>No matter which classification the worker falls under, they cannot be considered both an employee and a <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> worker under one contract or agreement. Each case must be reviewed on its own merits. It is however possible for a worker to be considered an employee under a contract or agreement, while at the same time being considered a <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> worker under another contract or agreement.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. D is an employee of Company X. He drives Company X’s truck to haul medical goods and food products where they tell him to go. He has a regular 4-day work schedule and he is paid hourly. He has to ask permission to be absent from work.</li>
<li>Mr. D is also a <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> worker. He owns his own truck and advertises his moving services in the local newspaper. In the evening and on weekends, he offers his services to different clients to haul furniture in his truck. He sets the price for his services, and he can accept or refuse work. Mr. D hires and pays helpers from time to time to help him with loading and unloading the furniture.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, Mr. D is considered an employee under his contract with Company X while at the same time he is considered <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span> for the work performed for different clients.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Neutral or unclear facts</summary>
<p>Some facts about the working relationship of truck drivers may be considered neutral or unclear. Neutral or unclear facts are facts that support the conclusion that a person is an employee just as much as they support the conclusion that the person is a self-employed worker.</p>
<p>When the conditions of employment of a truck driver are imposed by trucking industry laws, the conditions are considered neutral or unclear facts.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>Every truck driver</strong>, whether self-employed or hired as an employee:</p>
<ul>
<li>is required to have a valid driver’s licence</li>
<li>must fill out a daily driving activities log and follow the NSC hours of service standard requirements for hours of driving and <span class="nowrap">off-duty</span> time</li>
<li>has to daily inspect (circle checks) the truck they are driving</li>
<li>is responsible for securing loads and making sure the truck meets load and size limits</li>
<li>has to report accidents or traffic violations to the payer or to the holder of the NSC safety fitness certificate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Every carrier:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>has to make sure each driver is a qualified and safe driver</li>
<li>has to keep records of each driver’s training, incidents, collisions, and convictions history</li>
<li>has to make sure all trucks operated under their NSC safety fitness certificate are properly maintained (therefore, an <span class="nowrap">owner-operator</span> hired by a carrier has to provide maintenance records of their truck since it affects the carrier’s safety rating)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are other examples of facts that are considered neutral when they are imposed by law or because of insurance reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>the contract between the truck driver and the payer states that the worker accepts to follow the payer’s policies and procedures about road safety, border crossing, drug and alcohol testing, etc., when those policies are required by law</li>
<li>in respect to insurance, the contract between the truck driver and the payer:<ul>
<li>includes an exclusivity clause (for example, because the truck is covered by the carrier’s insurance)</li>
<li>states that the worker can subcontract only to workers the payer approves</li>
<li>states that the worker may not have any passengers in the truck unless they are approved by the payer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some conditions of employment can also be dictated by an agreement signed by the payer and their clients or third parties. In this case, the following conditions are considered neutral because they are related to the business relationship between the payer and their clients rather than the working relationship between the worker and the payer. The clients or third parties could:</p>
<ul>
<li>impose deadlines the driver is required to meet (for example, when hauling perishable goods)</li>
<li>dispatch the driver directly</li>
<li>require criminal record checks and security clearances</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The payer, Company A, requires all the truck drivers to deliver the goods within a certain time frame and to report any traffic infraction they receive while driving their trucks. The payer is responsible for paying the insurance on all trailers and cargo and, therefore, must approve of any passengers in the truck.</p>
<p>Although these conditions of employment are usually indicators of control, they would be considered neutral in this situation because they are imposed by trucking industry laws or for insurance reasons.</p>
