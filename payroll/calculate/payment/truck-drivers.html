<p>You may hire a worker as a truck driver under a variety of legal arrangements. Depending on the situation, your withholding and reporting responsibilities will be different. </p>

   <ul>
<li><a href="#steps">Steps</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3">References</a></li>
</ul>

 <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
 <p>You need to review your contract (written or verbal) to confirm if the contract is with the <strong>truck driver’s corporation</strong> or with the truck driver <strong>directly</strong>. </p>
<p>Use the steps based on who you made the contract with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#subtab1" class="wb-tabs-ext">Contract is with the truck driver’s corporation</a> </li>
<li><a href="#subtab2" class="wb-tabs-ext">Contract is with the truck driver directly</a> </li>
</ul>


<div class="wb-tabs mrgn-tp-lg">
    <div class="tabpanels">
      <details id="subtab1">
        <summary>Truck driver’s corporation</summary>

<p>If your contract is with the <strong>truck driver’s corporation</strong>, your withholding and reporting requirements for payments you make to their corporation are different from those you have for payments you make to employees and self-employed workers. </p>
<details><summary>Special situation: Truck driver’s corporation who may be carrying on a <strong>personal services business</strong> (PSB)</summary>

<p>If the truck driver is performing services through their own corporation, depending on whether their corporation meets certain conditions, the truck driver’s corporation may be considered to be carrying on a PSB.</p>
<h3>Why is it <strong>important</strong> for the truck driver to determine if their corporation is carrying on a PSB</h3>
<p>It is important for the truck driver to determine if the corporation is carrying on a PSB because special rules may apply to their corporation for income tax purposes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The income earned from carrying on a PSB is <strong>not eligible</strong> for the general tax reduction or the small business deduction, which allow certain other corporations to reduce their corporate tax rates</li>
<li>PSBs are subject to an <strong>additional 5% tax</strong> </li>
<li>PSBs are <strong>limited</strong> in the types of expenses they may deduct from their income</li>
</ul> 
<p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-income-tax-return/tax-implications-personal-services-business/factors-psb.html">Determine if the worker’s corporation is carrying on a PSB</a></p> 

</details>
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

 <li><h3 id="step1_1">Determine if you need to withhold deductions</h3>
<p>You (as the payer of the truck driver’s corporation) are <strong>not</strong> responsible to withhold the following from amounts you pay their corporation:</p>

 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>  Income tax <small>(do not withhold)</small></li>
 <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>  <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions <small>(do not withhold)</small></li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>  <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> premiums <small>(do not withhold)</small></li>

</ul>

<p>The truck driver may be <strong>an employee of their own corporation</strong>. The payroll obligations for the truck driver’s corporation (whether or not the corporation is carrying on a PSB) are the same as those that apply to regular employers. </p>
<p>The truck driver’s corporation is responsible to withhold deductions from amounts paid to their employees and report the amounts on a T4 slip.</p>
</li>

 <li><h3 id="step2_1">Determine if the payment made is for a good or for a service</h3>

<details><summary>Example - Payment made for <strong>services only</strong></summary>
<p>Your corporation contracts another business to only provide driving, loading, and unloading services in the trucking industry.  
</p>

<p>In this example, you would report on a T4A slip the payment made to another business for the provision of services. </p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example - Payment made for <strong>services and goods</strong></summary>
<p>Your corporation contracts another business to provide driving, loading, and unloading services in the trucking industry, as well as to do repairs on your corporation’s vehicles. As part of their invoice, they bill your corporation for parts used in these repairs.  </p>

<h3>Example 1: General freight</h3>
<p>
123 Distribution Co., a company who distributes packaged food products across Canada and whose primary source of business income is more than 50% from trucking activities, hires ABC Haulage Inc., a CCPC in the trucking industry, to transport shipments from its Ontario warehouse to retail markets.
</p>
<p>
123 Distribution Co. paid a combined total of $8,000 to ABC Haulage Inc. for transportation services provided during July and August.
</p>
<p>In this situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because the total of all payments made to ABC Haulage Inc. exceeds $500 in the calendar year, 123 Distribution Co. must complete a T4A slip and report $8,000 in box 048, Fees for services.</li>
  <li>123 Distribution Co. must issue the completed T4A slip to ABC Haulage Inc. by the last day of February of the following calendar year and must include this amount in its T4A Summary, which it must send to the CRA.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 2: Specialized freight</h3>
<p>
In October, Heavy Duty Moving Ltd., which specializes in transporting industrial machinery and earns 90% of its income from trucking activities, contracts three CCPCs in the trucking industry to assist with moving oversized generators within Ontario, $50,000 for services provided in October and November for the three contracted companies.
</p>
<p>In this situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because the total payments made to each CCPC in the trucking industry exceed $500 in the calendar year, Heavy Duty Moving Ltd. must issue three separate T4A slips – one for each CCPC. Each slip must report the respective amount Heavy Duty Moving Ltd. paid to that CCPC in Box 048, Fees for services.</li>
  <li>Heavy Duty Moving Ltd. must issue the completed T4A slips to each CCPC by the last day of February of the following calendar year and include the total amount of fees paid to all three CCPCs in its T4A Summary, which it must send to the CRA.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 3: Courier services (non-trucking business)</h3>
<p>
In August, Speedy Z, a courier service with 95% of its income earned from parcel delivery and messenger services, hired Quick Shipping Inc., a CCPC in the trucking industry, to transport office supplies between its distribution centers. Speedy Z made payments totaling $6,000 for services rendered in August.
</p>
<p>In this situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because Speedy Z’s primary business activity is courier services, not trucking activities, the fees it pays for services do not fall under the applicable activities associated with the lift of the moratorium on penalties for failure to report fees for service in the trucking industry.</li>
  <li>Speedy Z, under the Income Tax Act, is still required to report the fees it paid to Quick Shipping Inc. in box 048 of the T4A slip, as well as in its T4A Summary which it must send to the CRA by the last day of February of the following calendar year.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 4: Refrigerated warehousing and storage (non-trucking business)</h3>
<p>
In September, Fruits &amp; Vegetables Ltd., a frozen goods warehousing facility that earns its income primarily from storing temperature-controlled goods, hires ABC Freez Inc., a CCPC in the trucking industry, to transport its frozen products from the warehouse to multiple retail locations.
</p>
<p>
Fruits &amp; Vegetables Ltd. made a total payment of $12,000 to ABC Freez Inc. for transportation services it provided in September and October.
</p>
<p>In this situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because Fruits and Vegetables Ltd.’s primary business activity is temperature-controlled goods and not trucking activities, the fees it pays for services do not fall under the applicable activities associated with the lift of the moratorium on penalties for failure to report fees for service in the trucking industry.</li>
  <li>Under the Income Tax Act, Fruits and Vegetables Ltd. is still required to report the fees it paid to ABC Freez Inc. in box 048 of the T4A slip, as well as in its T4A Summary which it must send to the CRA by the last day of February of the following calendar year.</li>
