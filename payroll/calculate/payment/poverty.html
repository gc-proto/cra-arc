<p>This new content has been developed for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the current CRA administrative policy</strong>.</p>

<p>You may have employees who are members of a religious order who have taken a vow of poverty. Depending on the situation, if your employee meets all conditions, the income earned (including taxable benefits) by your employee will not be subject to CPP, EI or income tax withholding. </p>
<p>You have a legal obligation to report all income and deductions on a T4 slip regardless of whether the income is taxable or exempt.</p>

<li><h3 id="step2">Determine if your employee has taken a vow of poverty </h3>
<p>You need to determine if your employee who is a member of a religious order has taken a vow of poverty. </p>

<p>A vow of poverty is a pledge or promise of a member of a religious order to renounce temporal goods to follow God. </p>
<p>The member of the religious order commits to <strong>giving their entire earned income over to the religious order of which they are a member</strong>.  </p>

 <div id="ajax-temporary">
<p>The vow is referred to as:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or  cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Under the Income Tax Act and the Canada Pension Plan, a vow of perpetual poverty</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Under the Employment Insurance Act, a vow of poverty</li>

<p>If your employee is considered a member of a religious order (step 1) who has taken a vow of poverty (step 2), your employee <strong>must</strong> provide you with the required records <strong>before</strong> you can stop the withholding source deductions.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Income paid directly to the religious order</h4>

<p> If they have not previously claimed the deduction on line 25600 of their personal income tax return, they may be asked to provide a letter from the religious order confirming that they are a member and have taken a vow of poverty. </p>
