<p>This new content has been developed for clarity, completeness and plain language. It has also been developed to include a <strong>new CRA administrative policy</strong> applicable to <strong>payments of fees for services to truck drivers</strong> impacted by Budget 2025, and the circumstances under which T4A slips needs to be filed for these workers. This policy is for <strong>slips filed for calendar year 2026 and after</strong>, and is identified with the tag <span class="label label-warning">New CRA administrative policy.</span></p>

<p>You may hire a worker as a truck driver under a variety of legal arrangements. Depending on the situation, your withholding and reporting responsibilities will be different. </p>

   <ul>
<li><a href="#steps">Steps</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3">References</a></li>
</ul>

 <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
 <p>You need to review your contract (written or verbal) to confirm if the contract is with the <strong>truck driver’s corporation</strong> or with the truck driver <strong>directly</strong>. </p>
<p>Use the steps based on who you made the contract with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#subtab1" class="wb-tabs-ext">Contract is with the truck driver’s corporation</a> </li>
<li><a href="#subtab2" class="wb-tabs-ext">Contract is with the truck driver directly</a> </li>

    <div class="tabpanels">
      <details id="subtab1">
        <summary>Truck driver’s corporation</summary>

<p>If your contract is with the <strong>truck driver’s corporation</strong>, your withholding and reporting requirements for payments you make to their corporation are different from those you have for payments you make to employees and self-employed workers. </p>
<details><summary>Special situation: Truck driver’s corporation who may be carrying on a <strong>personal services business</strong> (PSB)</summary>

<p>If the truck driver is performing services through their own corporation, depending on whether their corporation meets certain conditions, the truck driver’s corporation may be considered to be carrying on a PSB.</p>
<h3>Why is it <strong>important</strong> for the truck driver to determine if their corporation is carrying on a PSB</h3>
<p>It is important for the truck driver to determine if the corporation is carrying on a PSB because special rules may apply to their corporation for income tax purposes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The income earned from carrying on a PSB is <strong>not eligible</strong> for the general tax reduction or the small business deduction, which allow certain other corporations to reduce their corporate tax rates</li>
<li>PSBs are subject to an <strong>additional 5% tax</strong> </li>
<li>PSBs are <strong>limited</strong> in the types of expenses they may deduct from their income</li>
</ul> 
<p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-income-tax-return/tax-implications-personal-services-business/factors-psb.html">Determine if the worker’s corporation is carrying on a PSB</a></p> 

</details>
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

 <li><h3 id="step1_1">Determine if you need to withhold deductions</h3>
<p>You (as the payer of the truck driver’s corporation) are <strong>not</strong> responsible to withhold the following from amounts you pay their corporation:</p>

 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>  Income tax <small>(do not withhold)</small></li>
 <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>  <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions <small>(do not withhold)</small></li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>  <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> premiums <small>(do not withhold)</small></li>

</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>The truck driver may be <strong>an employee of their own corporation</strong>. The payroll obligations for the truck driver’s corporation (whether or not the corporation is carrying on a PSB) are the same as those that apply to regular employers. </p>
<p>The truck driver’s corporation is responsible to withhold deductions from amounts paid to their employees and report the amounts on a T4 slip.</p>
</div>
</li>

 <li><h3 id="step2_1">Determine if you need to report the payments on a T4A slip</h3>
<div id="ajax-cond-transportation">	 
 <p><span class="label label-warning">New CRA administrative policy</span> <strong>For calendar year 2025 and after</strong>, if you are an individual, partnership, trust, or corporation involved in trucking industry, you <strong>must</strong> report on a T4A slip if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>


<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your <a href="#primary" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">primary source of business income&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> is <strong>more than 50% </strong>from construction activities </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Payments were made to Canadian resident subcontractors for <strong>construction services performed inside or outside Canada</strong></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Total of all payments in the calendar year to a subconstractor were <strong>more than $500</strong>, not including  GST/HST (payments made for goods only do not have to be reported)</li>
</ul>
<p>If a subcontractor performs services as an employee <strong>in addition to services as a subcontractor</strong>, the employment income should be reported on a <strong>T4 </strong>and the subcontract work is reported on a <strong>T5018</strong>.</p>

 <details>  <summary >What is considered the <strong>primary source of business income</strong></summary>     
<div id="ajax-primary">
<p id="h-3-2">If <strong>more than 50% of a business' income-earning activities are construction</strong>, the primary source of business income is considered to be construction.</p>
<p>In many cases there are businesses that have significant amounts of construction done for them or by them, but this activity is not their principal business and the business does not have to report under the contract payment reporting (CPRS).</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>A natural gas company does large amounts of construction to install pipelines. The principal business is gas transmission and not constructing pipelines.</p>
<p>In this situation, the company is not required to report under the CPRS. However, the CRA will accept the T5018 return if the company sends it.</p>
