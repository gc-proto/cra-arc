<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Content has been updated for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirement. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>You may provide a wage loss replacement plan (WLRP) for short-term disability to your employees. Depending on your situation, you can apply for the <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premium reduction rate through Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). </p>

<p>Learn more on how and when to apply for a premium reduction through ESDC, including what you have to send with your application:<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/ei-employers/premium-reduction-program.html">ESDC | EI Premium Reduction Program: For employers</a></p>

<details><summary>What is a <abbr title="Wage-loss replacement plan">WLRP</abbr></summary>
<p>Generally, a <abbr title="Wage-loss replacement plan">WLRP</abbr> is an arrangement between an employer and employees, or an employer and a group or association of employees, where the employees receive benefits on a periodic basis for loss of employment income due to sickness, maternity or accident.</p>
<p> A <abbr title="Wage-loss replacement plan">WLRP</abbr> may provide short-term disability (STD), long-term disability (LTD) or weekly indemnity (WI) benefits. The benefits may be paid by the employer, or by an insurance company, trustee, board of trustees or other independent organization.</p>
<p>A <abbr title="Wage-loss replacement plan">WLRP</abbr> must meet <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It is a group plan, in that it covers more than one employee </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The purpose of the plan is to indemnify employees against a loss of employment income as a result of sickness, accident or maternity </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Benefits are paid on a periodic basis, not as a lump-sum </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It follows insurance principles that funds are accumulated, normally in the hands of a trustee or in a trust account, and are calculated to be sufficient to meet anticipated claims </li>
</ul>

</details>
</div>
<p>If the plan is not a group plan (that is it is for a single employee), or if the plan is funded entirely by employee contributions (an employee-pay-all plan), it is a <abbr title="Wage-loss replacement plan">WLRP</abbr>. </p>

<h4>Opening a separate payroll account</h4>
<p>Once ESDC approves your request for a reduced <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> employer premium rate, your existing payroll deduction account will be set at your new reduced <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premium rate.</p>
<p>You will have to send a request to the CRA to open a separate <a href="#account" aria-controls="mid-screen" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">payroll account&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> under your existing business number (BN) to make separate remittances at the regular <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premium rate for employees not covered by the wage-loss replacement plan.</p>	
<p>Learn more: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/register/index.html">Open or manage a payroll account</a></p>


<h4>Reporting on T4 slips</h4>
<p>You have to report income paid to your employees on separate T4 returns for each payroll account under your <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>. For example:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">RP0001, EI premium reduction rate - For employees covered under an approved plan</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">RP0002, Standard rate of 1.4 times the employee's premiums - For employees who are <strong>not</strong> covered by the plan</li>
</ul>
<p>Where an employee was transferred between both accounts in the same calendar year, you also have to file a separate T4 slip for each account.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: You pay an amount to your employee for 5/12 of any savings in the year in which you received the EI premium reduction</summary>

<p>If you pay an amount to your employee for 5/12 of any savings in the year in which you received the EI premium reduction (or within the first 4 months of the following year), the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if it is considered non-cash or near-cash (exempt from taxation 6(1)(a)).</p>
<p>For example, the benefit is provided indirectly through increased employer contributions to an employee's health and welfare trust, group sickness or accident insurance plan, private health services plan, or in any other manner. </p>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you pay an amount to your employee in cash, such as a cash allowance or a cash rebate, the benefit is taxable.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: You pay for a <strong>top-up disability payment</strong> (as per subsection 6(17))</summary>
<p id="top">Determine if the top-up disability payment you, as an employer, make is to the insurer or directly to the employee.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: You paid <strong>directly the insurer</strong></summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you make a top-up disability payment, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Insurer is making <strong>periodic payments </strong>under a disability plan to your employee that <strong>became insolvent</strong> </li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">The obligated insurer <strong>continues periodic payments</strong>, in whole or in part, to your employee under the policy </li>
</ul>
<p>These are payments you makee direclty to the insurer and not to your employee.  In this situation, this is not considered to be a benefit received or enjoyed by your employee.</p>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the payments you make <strong>does not</strong> meet all of the above conditions, the benefit is taxable.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: You paid <strong>directly your employee </strong></summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
