<p>You may continue to pay your employee their regular wages or an advance or loan, before or after a claim is decided for workers’ compensation benefits for lost wages because of an employment-related injury. Depending on the situation, your withholding and reporting responsibilities will be different. <p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
<li><h3 id="step1">Determine if the payments are considered regular salary or an advance or loan</h3>
<p>Your withholding and reporting on payments you make anticipating a workers’ compensation award will be different depending on whether the payments are considered regular salary paid to an employee or advances or loans.</p>			 
<p>This will depend on the wording in your employee’s collective agreement or employment contract:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>If your employee’s agreement or contract <strong>does not</strong> refer to payments from a worker’s compensation board, you should treat the payments as regular salary.</p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>If there is wording in the employee’s collective agreement that <strong>links</strong> the payments to a workers’ compensation board decision, then the employer can treat them as an advance or loan. For example, an agreement may say an employee shall be granted injury-on-duty leave with pay for the time approved by the provincial workers’ compensation board.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to both: </p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
	<li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>self-insured employers</strong> who are directly liable for the cost of amounts that the workers’ compensation board awards to employees </li>
	<li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>regular employers</strong> who are not directly liable for the cost of amounts that the workers’ compensation board awards to employees </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Special situation: Adjustment period</summary>
<p>In many cases, employers prepare payroll cheques in advance. As a result, it may not always be possible to place an employee on a loan or advance system right after they file a claim. If this happens, you are allowed a reasonable period (normally one pay period) to adjust your payroll records to an advance or a loan basis.</p>
</details>
</li>	

<li><h3 id="step2">Determine your withholding and reporting obligations</h3>
<p>Your withholding and reporting obligations for payments you make anticipating a workers compensation award will differ depending on the situation:</p>
<h4>Situations</h4>
<details><summary>Situation: Regular salary paid to your employee (approved claim)</summary>
<p>If you, as the employer, continue to pay a regular salary to your employee, you will continue to deduct CPP contributions, EI premiums, and income tax from their salary. You would report their salary as employment income and the CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax withheld on your employee’s T4 slip.</p>
<p>If you, as the employer, continued to pay your employee’s regular salary before and after a workers’ compensation board claim was decided, you <strong>cannot</strong> retroactively reduce your employee’s employment income in the current year <strong>or</strong> amend a previous year’s T4 slip and call the earnings workers’ compensation benefits. As you cannot change the T4 slips or current-year payroll records in this situation, you <strong>cannot</strong> recover your share of the CPP and EI contributions relating to these payments.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Regular salary paid to your employee (denied claim)</summary>
<p>If you, as the employer, continued to pay regular salary to your employee and <strong>included</strong> these amounts in your employee’s employment income in a previous year, if the worker’s compensation board <strong>denies</strong> the claim afterward and the employee <strong>does not</strong> have to repay you, you <strong>do not</strong> have to withhold further deductions or change how you reported the payment.</p>
<p>If your employee <strong>must</strong> repay you when the claim is denied, then any repayments should be handled in the way discussed under “The employee did not perform their duties or the amount paid is more than 3 years after the end of the year in which the salary was overpaid,” at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/file-information-returns-slip-summaries/make-corrections-after-filing/correct.html">Correct deduction errors - Canada.ca</a> </p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Advances or loans you pay (approved claim)</summary>
<p>If you pay advances or loans to your employee that are equivalent to an anticipated workers’ compensation award, they <strong>will not</strong> be treated as employment income. As a result, you <strong>do not</strong> have to deduct CPP contributions, EI premiums, or income tax on this amount.</p>
<p>Any interest that accumulates on advances or loans while waiting for a workers’ compensation claim decision is <strong>not considered</strong> to be a taxable benefit.  You <strong>do not</strong> report these amounts on your employee’s T4 slip and code 77 <strong>does not</strong> apply.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Advances or loans you pay (denied claim)</summary>
<p>Normally, advances or loans are offset or repaid when a claim is paid by the workers' compensation board. You do not have to report advances or loans paid to your employee which were offset or repaid on their T4 slip.</p>
<p>If the workers' compensation board denies a claim, and the advance or loan is not repaid in the year the claim is settled, your employee is considered to have received a benefit from employment in the year that the claim is denied. The amount of the loan or advance has to be reported on a T4 slip with CPP contributions, EI premiums, and income tax withheld. </p>
<p>If the claim is denied and you use the employee's sick leave credits to repay the advance or loan, the amount of the advance or loan must be reported on a T4 slip with CPP contributions, EI premiums, and income tax withheld. </p>
<p>If the required income tax deductions cause undue hardship to the employee, the employee must get a letter of authority before you can reduce the amount of tax you are required to deduct. Learn more on how your employee can apply for a letter of authority: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/set-up-new-employee/increase-reduce-income-tax-deducted-source.html#wb-cont">Increase or reduce income tax deducted at source - Canada.ca </a> </p>	
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Advances from a third party</summary>
<p>If an insurance company pays your employee an amount equivalent to their regular salary, the insurer will issue a T4A slip. </p>
<p>If the payments are later repaid by the workers' compensation board or by the employee to the insurance company, the insurance company will issue, for the year of the repayment, a receipt or a letter to your employee. This will let your employee claim a deduction for the repayment of this amount on their income tax and benefit return.</p>
</details>
</details> </li>

<li><h3 id="step3">Report the payment on a slip</h3>
<p>If you are required to report the payments you make anticipating a workers' compensation award, you must report the following amounts on the employee's T4 slip:</p>
	<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg"><li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"> </span> Box 14 - Employment income </li>
				    <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li  text-success"> </span> Box 24 - <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> insurable earnings</li>
				    <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li  text-success"> </span> Box 26 - <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>/<abbr title="Quebec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> pensionable earnings</li>
 				  </ul>	
<p>Learn more: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/file/t4slip.html">T4 slip - Information for employers</a></p>

<p>If a worker’s compensation claim is <strong>reimbursed to you</strong>, you may have to report code 77 on your employee’s T4 slip.</p>
<p><strong>Only use</strong> code 77 to report the amount of reimbursed workers’ compensation amounts where: </p>
<ul>
	<li>you previously paid the employee the workers' compensation amount and reported it as an employment income on the employee's T4 slip</li>
	<li>you have now been reimbursed by the WCB for the worker's compensation amount you paid to the employee</li>
</ul>	
<p><strong>Do not</strong> use code 77 if the award was only used to offset or pay advances or loans you had paid to your employee and not included on their T4 slip.</p>
<p>This allows your employee to deduct this amount against the previously paid salary.</p>	
<p>The amount a <strong>self-insured employer</strong> should enter under code 77 will be the amount of approved WCB benefits shown in the letter or statement the employer received from the WCB. </p>
<details><summary>Why Code 77 is required</summary>
<p>In the year that the worker’s compensation claim is reimbursed to you, your employee will also receive a T5007 slip from the workers’ compensation board (WCB).</p>
<p>Generally, income tax is not paid on the workers' compensation benefits, but the employee <strong>must</strong> report the amount shown on the T5007 slip as income on their income tax and benefit return for that year and claim the corresponding deduction.</p>	
<p>For the employee to also deduct all or part of the reimbursed worker's compensation as "other employment expenses" on their income tax and benefit return, you <strong>have to</strong> fill out a T4 slip reporting the amount of the reimbursed workers’ compensation amounts for the year in which you receive the reimbursement. </p>
