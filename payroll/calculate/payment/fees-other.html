<details><summary>When are executor, administrator and power of attorney's fees considered fees for services</summary>
<h3>Executor fees</h3>
<p>An executor is an individual or trust institution named in a will and confirmed by a court to settle a deceased's estate. When a will does not exist, or the will does not name an executor, a court will appoint an administrator to handle the deceased's estate. Often, executors and administrators are paid a fee for their services.</p>
<h3>Power of attorney fees</h3>
<p>A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document where one person gives another person power to act on their behalf related to specific tasks. When someone has been delegated as a power of attorney over another person, they do not always have the same rights as an executor, however, the deductions for the fees paid are treated the same.  </p>
<h3>Deductions and reporting</h3>
<p>Fees paid to an executor, administrator, or a person who has a delegated power of attorney are either considered <strong>business income</strong> or income from <strong>office or employment</strong>.</p>
