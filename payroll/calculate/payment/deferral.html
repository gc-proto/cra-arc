<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Content has been updated for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirements. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>You may have a salary deferral arrangement with your employees. Under such an arrangement, an employee postpones receiving salary and wages to a later year. The amount postponed is called a "deferred amount." Depending on whether the arrangement is a prescribed arrangement, your withholding and reporting obligations will differ.</p>

 <h2 id="h_1">Steps</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
	
<li><h3 id="step1">Confirm if the salary deferral arrangement is a prescribed plan</h3>
<p>Your withholding and reporting obligations on amounts to be paid under a salary deferral arrangement depend on whether the salary deferral arrangement is a prescribed plan or not.</p>
<p>The conditions a plan has to meet to be a prescribed plan are found in paragraph 6801(a) of the Income Tax Regulations.</p>
<details><summary>If you are not sure if the salary deferral arrangement is a prescribed plan</summary>
<p>To be a prescribed plan, the plan or arrangement must meet <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It is an arrangement in writing between an employer and an employee established on or after July 28, 1986 intended to fund through salary or wage deferrals a leave of absence of not less than six consecutive months (<strong>unless</strong> it was for purposes of full-time attendance at an educational institution, where it is not less than three consecutive months)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The period the salary or wages are deferred <strong>cannot be longer than</strong> six years after the date on which the deferrals began</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The amount deferred <strong>cannot be more than 33.3333%</strong> of the amount of salary and wages they would reasonably have received if not for the arrangement</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The arrangement provides that during the leave the employee <strong>cannot receive</strong> any salary and wages from the employer <strong>other than</strong> deferred salary or wages or reasonable taxable benefits the employer usually pays</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The employee must return to regular employment for a period not less than the period of the leave with their employer or an employer that participates in the same or similar arrangement</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The arrangement provides that all amounts held for the employee’s benefit under the arrangement shall be paid out to the employee no later than the end of the first year the begins after the end of the deferral period </li>
</ul></details>
 </li>

<li><h3 id="step2">Determine when the deferred amounts must be reported as income for your employee</h3>
<p>When you have to include the deferred amounts in your employee's income depends on whether the arrangement is a prescribed plan or not:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Prescribed plan</h5>
<p>If the arrangement is a prescribed plan, the deferred amounts will be treated as employment income in the year your employee <strong>actually receives</strong> them.</p>
<p>Any interest income earned under these plans or arrangements will be treated as employment income and you must withhold CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions from these amounts.</p>
 </li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Nor a prescribed plan</h5>
<p>If the arrangement is not a prescribed plan, the deferred amounts will be treated as employment income in the year your employee <strong>earns</strong> them.</p>
 </li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li><h3 id="step3">Determine when you must withhold payroll deductions from the deferred amounts</h3>
<ol class="lst-stps-sub ld-zr stps-strpd">
 <li><h4>Determine when you must withhold CPP contributions</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Prescribed plan</h5>
<p>If the arrangement is a prescribed plan, you must withhold CPP contributions from the deferred amounts only when they are actually paid to your employee during the leave period.</p>
<p>You must still withhold CPP contributions from their net salary (the salary minus the deferred amounts) while your employee is working.</p>
 </li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Nor a prescribed plan</h5>
<p>If the arrangement is not a prescribed plan, you must withhold CPP contributions from the deferred amounts when they are earned by the employee in the usual way you withhold CPP contributions on their salary and wages.</p>

<li><h4>Determine when you must withhold EI premiums</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Prescribed plan</h5>
<p>If the arrangement is a prescribed plan, you must withhold EI premiums from the employee’s gross salary (including the deferred amounts) while your employee is working. You do not withhold EI premiums when the deferred amounts are actually paid to your employee during the leave period.</p>
 </li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Nor a prescribed plan</h5>
<p>If the arrangement is not a prescribed plan, you must withhold EI premiums from the deferred amounts when they are earned by the employee in the usual way you withhold EI premiums on their salary and wages.</p>

</li>
<li><h4>Determine when you must withhold income tax deductions</h4> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Prescribed plan</h5>
<p>If the arrangement is a prescribed plan, you must withhold income tax deductions from the deferred amounts only when they are actually paid to your employee during the leave period. </p>
