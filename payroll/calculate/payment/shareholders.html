<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Shareholder benefits</h1>

<p>You may need to determine if a benefit provided to a shareholder is a taxable benefit (for the purposes of subsection 15(1) of the Income Tax Act)</p>
<p>If the shareholder benefit is taxable, you need to determine how to calculate the value, which payroll deductions you need to withhold from the payment and how to report on a T4A slip. </p>
		 
<details><summary><strong>Before you begin</strong> - You must confirm if this content applies to you</summary>
