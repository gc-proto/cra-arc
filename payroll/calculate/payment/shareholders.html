<p>You may provide benefits to one of your <a href="#ajax-shareholder" aria-controls="ajax-shareholder" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">shareholders<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> in their <strong>capacity as a shareholder</strong> or to a <a href="#ajax-related" aria-controls="ajax-related" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">related person<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> or an <a href="#ajax-affiliated" aria-controls="ajax-affiliated" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">affiliated person<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> with your shareholder.</p>

<p>Shareholder benefits can take almost any form. However, shareholder benefits <strong>do not</strong> include benefits a shareholder receives in their <strong>capacity as an employee</strong>.</p>

<details><summary>Examples of shareholder benefits</summary>
<p>The following are some examples of shareholder benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments to a shareholder by you (as a corporation), other than as part of a good faith business transaction</li>
<li>Payment of your shareholder's personal expenses by you (as a corporation)</li>
<li>Sale of goods by a shareholder to you (as a corporation), for an amount greater than the fair market value (FMV)</li>
<li>Sale of goods by a corporation to you (as a corporation), for an amount less than FMV</li>
<li>Additions or improvement to a shareholder's property paid for by you (as a corporation)</li>
<li>Personal use of your (the corporation's) property (for example, house, car, yacht) without a FMV charge or return</li>
<li>Theft or embezzlement of funds by a shareholder</li>
<li>Training costs reimbursed to your shareholder</li>
<li>Private health-care plans</li>
<li>Shareholder’s life insurance premiums paid by you (as a corporation)</li>
<li>Guarantees provided by you (as a corporation), in respect of your shareholder's personal loans</li>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
  
<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
<li> <h3 id="step1">Determine if the benefit was received from the corporation as an employee or a shareholder</h3>
<p>To determine if the benefit is a shareholder benefit, you must determine if the benefit was received from the corporation in the shareholder’s capacity as:
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A shareholder</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">An employee</li>
</ul>
<h4>Review all factors </h4>
<p>This is a <strong>question of fact</strong>, and each benefit your shareholder received must be reviewed independently of any other benefit that they received. Your shareholder must have known or reasonably should have known that they were receiving the benefit.</p>

<h4>Why is it important to determine if your corporation is providing a benefit to a worker in their capacity as a shareholder</h4>
<p>It is important to determine if your corporation is providing a shareholder benefit to an individual in their <strong>capacity as a shareholder</strong> because of the following tax obligations which affect both your corporation and your shareholder:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Your corporation</h5>
<ul> 
<li>You <strong>do not</strong> withhold payroll deductions from shareholder benefits</li>
<li>You have to report the shareholder benefit on a <strong>T4A slip</strong></li>
<li>You <strong>cannot</strong> claim the shareholder benefit as a <strong>business expense</strong> (unlike an employee benefit)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Your shareholder</h5>
<ul> 
<li>Your <strong>shareholder is responsible for remitting</strong> income tax and <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions when filing their income tax and benefit return</li> 
<li>Your shareholder will include the full amount of the shareholder benefit included on the T4A slip using <strong>line 13000 – Other income</strong> or <strong>lines 13499 to 14300 – Self-employment income</strong> on their income tax and benefit return</li>  
</ul></li> 
</ul>

</ul>


</li>
<li><h3 id="step2">Determine if the benefit provided is considered a shareholder benefit</h3>
<p>If the benefit to your shareholder is provided in <strong>one</strong> of the following situations, it is <strong>not</strong> considered a shareholder benefit:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Dividends</h4>
<p>You pay dividends to your shareholder, which are a return on the shareholder’s investment in the company and are not considered as payment for services provided for the corporation.</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Deemed dividends </h4>
<p>You make the following transactions which are deemed to be a dividend paid to your shareholders under the Income Tax Act:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Paid-up capital (the amount paid or contributed by your shareholders for their shares that exist) of the corporation increases other than by means of a securities dividend without a corresponding increase in net assets or decrease in net liabilities </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Property is distributed to shareholders when a corporation's business is wound-up, discontinued, or reorganized </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Any of the company's own shares are redeemed, acquired, or cancelled, other than by an ordinary purchase in the open market </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Paid-up capital for any class of shares of capital stock is reduced </li>
</ul>
<p>A common deemed dividend is a share buyback, where your corporation buys back the shares held by your shareholder for more than they had originally paid for them, often because they are unable to sell them to a third party. </p>
</li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Other exceptions</h4>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> A return of invested capital </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Right to acquire additional capital stock </li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger fa-lg"> </span> If the benefit provided to your shareholder is in <strong>one</strong> of the above situations, <strong>do not</strong> continue to the next step.</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p><span class="fas fa-arrow-down text-success fa-lg"></span> If the benefit provided to your shareholder is <strong>not</strong> in one of the above situations, continue to: <a href="#step4">Step 4 - Calculate the value of the shareholder benefit</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
 </li>

<li><h3 id="step4">Calculate the value of the shareholder benefit </h3>
<p>If you provide a shareholder benefit to a worker in their <strong>capacity as a shareholder</strong> not included in step 3, the value of the benefit is based on <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The FMV of the property or benefit being conferred by the corporation on the shareholder </li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">The expenses and purchase price of the property that the corporation did not use to produce income from a business or property </li>

</ul>
 </li>

<li><h3 id="step5">Determine if you need to withhold payroll deductions</h3>
<p>You <strong>do not</strong> withhold the following from a shareholder benefit:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> Income tax - <strong>Do not</strong> withhold</li> 	 
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> premiums - <strong>Do not</strong> withhold</li> 
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions - <strong>Do not</strong> withhold</li> 
</ul> 
<p>A shareholder is responsible for remitting income tax and <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions on their shareholder benefits when filing their income tax and benefit return. </p>
</li>

<li><h3 id="step5">Report the shareholder benefit on a T4A slip</h3>

<p>You must report the shareholder benefit on a T4A slip depending on the type of benefit: </p>
 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Code 028 – Other income</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Code 117 – Loan benefits </li>
 				  </ul>
 <p>Under the CRA administrative policy, a slip <strong>must</strong> be issued if the total of all payments in the calendar year were <strong>more than $500</strong> or you deducted tax from the payment.</p>  
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-1 col-sm-1">
<span class="fa-stack pull-left">
    <span class="fas fa-exchange-alt fa-stack-1x"></span>
    <span class="fas fa-ban fa-stack-2x text-danger"></span>
  </span>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-11">
<p>After your T4A slip has been filed, you <strong>cannot change the nature of the income paid </strong>. Depending on your situation, this is considered retroactive tax planning and is inaccurately changing the reporting of the income.</p>
