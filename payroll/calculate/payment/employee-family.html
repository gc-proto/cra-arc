<p>You (as the employer) may have employees who are considered related to you if <strong>one</strong> of the following situations apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Confirm if individuals are considered related to you</h4>
<details><summary>Blood relationship</summary>
  
<p>The following individuals are <strong>related</strong> by blood:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A parent and a child (or another descendant, such as a grandchild or a great-grandchild)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A brother and a sister</li>
</ul>
<p>Blood relatives <strong>do not </strong>include more distant relatives such as aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews or cousins.</p>
</details>
 
<details><summary>Marriage</summary>
<p>Individuals are <strong>related</strong> if they are legally married to each other. They are also related to anyone connected by blood relationship (parents and siblings) to their spouse. </p>
<p>If the marriage is dissolved because of <strong>divorce or death of a spouse</strong>, the individual ceases to be connected by marriage.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Common-law partnership</summary>
<p>Individuals are <strong>related</strong> if they are in a common-law partnership with each other. The CRA considers that 2 individuals are in a common-law partnership in one of the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They live together in a conjugal relationship and have done so for a continuous period of at least 12 months</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They live together in a conjugal relationship and have a child together (this includes through adoption), in which case the 12-month period does not apply</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also related to anyone connected by blood relationship (parents and siblings) to their common-law partner. </p>
<p>If there is a <strong>breakdown in the relationship</strong>, they are considered to continue to live in a common-law partnership until they have lived separate and apart for <strong>90 consecutive days</strong>.</p>
</details>
	
<details><summary>Adoption</summary>
<p id="adopt">Individuals are <strong>related</strong> through adoption if one individual is the adopted child of the other. </p>
<p>In addition to their parents, the child is also related to their siblings, grandparents and great-grandparents.</p>
<p>Adoption includes legal adoption and de facto adoption. </p>
<p>The following factors are considered when determining whether a de facto adoption exists:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Actual control and custody</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">An exercise of parental care and responsibility on a continuing basis</li>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Dylan, Leonard, Donovan and Sarah form a partnership. Leonard, Donovan and Sarah are siblings (related). Dylan is their cousin which they means they are <strong>not</strong> related. Each has an equal 25% share in the profits.</p>
<h5>Result</h5>
<p>Since they are a related group that controls the partnership, Leonard, Donovan and Sarah <strong>do not</strong> deal at arm's length with the partnership. </p>

<h4>Factors to determine if you would have negotiated a similar contract</h4>
<p><strong>All the facts</strong> about the working relationship must be reviewed to see if other employees <strong>would have been hired under a similar contract of employment</strong>.</p>
 <p>Generally, the CRA reviews a combination of the following factors to determine whether the parties are dealing with each other at arm’s length (not just a single factor):</p>
<ul>
<li>Remuneration paid</li>
<li>Terms and conditions of employment, such as the hours of work</li>
<li>Duration of work performed</li>
<li>Nature and importance of the work performed by your employee</li>
</ul>
