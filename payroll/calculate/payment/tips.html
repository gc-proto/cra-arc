<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Tips received by employees</h1>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Content has been updated for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirement. </strong></p>
</div>

<p>Your employee may receive tips (directly or indirectly) as part of their employment duties with you. The tips are considered employment income for income tax purposes. </p>
<p>Depending on whether you <strong>control the tips or not</strong>, you may have to report the tips your employee received on a T4 slip and withhold payroll deductions.</p>
<h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>

<li><a href="#h_3">References</a></li>
</ul>
 <h2 id="h_1">Steps</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

<li><h3 id="step1">Review the method by which your employee received the tips</h3>

<p>The following are the different methods by which your employee can receive tips:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"> <h4>Controlled tips</h4>
<p>Controlled tips are when <strong>you (as the employer) control or possess</strong> the tips and you then <strong>must pay</strong> them to your employee.</p>
<p>You are <strong>considered to have paid</strong> these amounts to your employee because the tips are controlled by you (as the employer). </p>
<details><summary>Examples of controlled tips</summary>
<p>The following are some examples of controlled tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>The employer adds a mandatory service charge to a client's bill to cover tips </li>
<li>The employer adds a percentage to a client's bill to cover tips </li>
<li>Tips that are allocated to employees using a tip-sharing formula determined by the employer </li>
<li>Tips that an employer includes in his business income, then expenses and redistributes to employees in the form of pay </li>
<li>Tips that the employees turn over to their employer who then distributes them to the employees </li>
<li>Cash tips that are deposited into the employer's bank account and become, or are mixed in  with, the property of the employer and then paid out to the employees </li>
</ul>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>An employee is part of the serving staff in a restaurant. They receive tips from the restaurant's customers. However, some of the support staff believe that they should receive a share of those tips. The restaurant owner agrees to put in place a tip pool to make sure the tips are distributed among all staff members.  </p>
</details>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Direct tips</h4>
<p>Direct tips are when the <strong>customer paid</strong> the tips <strong>directly to your employee</strong>. </p>
<p>You (as the employer) have <strong>no control</strong> over the tip amount or its distribution.</p>
<details><summary>Examples of direct tips</summary>
<p>The following are some examples of direct tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>A customer leaves money on the table at the end of the meal and the server keeps the whole amount </li>
<li>A guest gives a tip directly to a bellhop, door person, car attendant, porter, etc. </li>
<li>The employees and not the employer decide how the tips are pooled or shared among employees </li>
<li>A customer includes an amount for a tip when paying the bill by credit or debit card and the employer returns the tip amount in cash to the employee at the end of the shift. In <strong>exceptional situations</strong> the cash tips could be paid out the day after, for example, if there was not enough available cash on hand </li>
</ul>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>An employee is part of the serving staff in a restaurant. The restaurant owner informs the employee that if a customer pays by credit or debit card and includes a voluntary tip, the restaurant will give the <strong>full</strong> tip amount to the employee in cash at the end of each shift.</p>
</details>

</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4><img src="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/images/flag-qc.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Declared tips - Quebec only</h4>
<p>Declared tips are amounts of tips that provincial law requires your employee to declare to you (as their employer), along with their controlled tips.</p>
<p>Employees working in a regulated establishment within the hospitality sector in Quebec must declare their <strong>direct tips</strong> to you.</p>
