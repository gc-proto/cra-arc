<p>You may provide tips and gratuities to your employee. Tips and gratuities are considered income earned in respect of employment for purposes of the Income Tax Act.</p>

<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

<li><h3 id="step1">Determine how the worker received the tips</h3>
<p>The following are the different types of method the worker can receive the tips:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"> <h4>Controlled tips - Controlled by employer</h4>
<p>Controlled tips is when <strong>you</strong>, as an employer, <strong>control or possess</strong> the tips and you pay them to your employee.</p>
<details><summary>Examples of controlled tips</summary>
<p>The following are some examples of controlled tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>The employer adds a mandatory service charge to a client's bill to cover tips </li>
<li>The employer adds a percentage to a client's bill to cover tips </li>
<li>Tips that are allocated to employees using a tip-sharing formula determined by the employer </li>
<li>Tips that an employer includes in his business income, then expenses and redistributes to employees in the form of pay </li>
<li>Tips that the employees turn over to their employer who then distributes them to the employees </li>
<li>Cash tips that are deposited into the employer's bank account and become, or are even commingled with, the property of the employer and then paid out to the employees</li>
<li>Debit card tips distribution system, the employer moves it to a third-party vendor to dispense</li>
</ul>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>You are part of the serving staff in a restaurant. You receive tips from the restaurant's customers. However, some of the support staff feel that they should receive a share of those tips. The restaurant owner agrees to put in place a tip pool to make sure the tips are distributed among all staff members. </p>
</details>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Direct tips - Paid directly to employee</h4>
<p>Direct tips is when the <strong>customer paid</strong> the tips <strong>directly to your employee</strong>. You, as an employer, have no control over the tip amount or its distribution.</p>
<details><summary>Examples of direct tips</summary>
<p>The following are some examples of direct tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>A customer leaves money on the table at the end of the meal and the server keeps the whole amount </li>
<li>A guest gives a tip directly to a bellhop, door person, car attendant, porter, etc. </li>
<li>The employees and not the employer decide how the tips are pooled or shared among employees </li>
<li>A customer includes an amount for a tip when paying the bill by credit or debit card and the employer returns the tip amount in cash to the employee at the end of the shift. In exceptional situations the cash tips could be paid out the day after, for example, if there was not enough available cash on hand </li>
</ul>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>You are part of the serving staff in a restaurant. The restaurant owner informs you that if a customer pays by credit or debit card and includes a voluntary tip, the restaurant will return the <strong>full </strong>tip amount back to you in cash at the end of each shift.</p>
</details>

</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4><img src="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/payroll/images/flag-qc.png" alt=""> Declared tips - Quebec only</h4>
<p>Declared tips are the amount of tips that provincial law requires an employee to declare to you, as an employer, along with their controlled tips. </p>
<p>Employees working in a regulated establishment within the hospitality sector in Quebec must declare their <strong>direct tips</strong> to you.</p>

</li>
</ul>
 </li>

<li><h3 id="step2">Determine which deductions you need withhold</h3>
<p>You must withhold the following deductions depending on how the worker received the tips: </p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Controlled tips</h4>
 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg">

 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li  text-success"> </span> <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions <small>- Withhold</small></li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Direct tips</h4>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> Income tax <small>- <strong>Do not</strong> withhold</small></li> 
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> <small>- <strong>Do not</strong> withhold</small></li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> <small>- <strong>Do not</strong> withhold, your employee can elect to pay <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions on tip amounts related to employement earnings by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt20.html">Form CPT20</a>, Election to Pay Canada Pension Plan Contributions when filing their personal income tax return.</small>
</li> 
</ul> 
 </li>
</ul>
<p>If your employee received <strong>both</strong> controlled and direct tips, <strong>only</strong> withhold deductions on the controlled tips. </p>

</li>

<li><h3 id="step3">Report the payment on a T4 slip</h3>
<p>You must report the following amounts on a <strong>T4 slip</strong> depending on how the worker received the tips:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Controlled tips</h4>
 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg"><li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"> </span> Box 14 - Employment Income </li>

				    <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li  text-success"> </span> Box 26 - CPP/QPP pensionable earnings</li>
	 			  </ul>

</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Direct tips</h4>
 <ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <strong>Do not</strong> report any amounts</li> 
	 			  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your employee received <strong>both</strong> controlled and direct tips, <strong>only</strong> report the controlled tips. </p>
