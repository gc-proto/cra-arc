<p>You may want to consult the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/workplace/federally-regulated-industries.html">Provincial and territorial employment standards</a> of your employee's province of employment to make sure you have met their requirements.

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">
<li><h3 id="step1">How to calculate insurable hours</h3>
<p>Hours of work are used to determine if workers are entitled to Employment Insurance (EI) benefits and for how long. If your employee leaves or there is an interruption of earnings, you <strong>must</strong> report these hours on a ROE.</p>
<p>How you determine the number of insurable hours varies depending on the terms of the employee’s employment in the situations below:  </p>
<h4>Situations</h4>
<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is paid hourly</summary>
<p>When an employee is paid hourly, the number of insurable hours is the number of hours actually worked and paid.</p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is <strong>not</strong> paid hourly</summary>
<p>When an employee is not paid hourly, if you (as the employer) know the number of hours that the employee actually worked and for which they were paid, the number of insurable hours is the number of hours that the employee actually worked and paid.</p>
<p>If you (as the employer) do not know the actual number of hours worked, you must use one of the following to determine the number of insurable hours:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You and the employee can agree on the number of insurable hours of work for which they are paid as part of their contract. For example, an agreement on hours on the value of piecework would determine the number of insurable hours in that situation.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If there is no agreement or you cannot reach an agreement, the insurable hours are determined by dividing the insurable earnings by the minimum wage. The result cannot be more than seven hours per day or 35 hours per week.</li></ul></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee's hours are limited by federal or provincial statutes</summary>
<p>If your full-time employee is limited by federal or provincial law to less than 35 hours per week, they will be creditd with insurable hours of 35 hours per week. A part-time employee in this situation will be credited with a proportionate number of hours.</p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: The employee is a full-time member of the military or police</summary>
<p>If the employee is a full-time member of the Canadian Forces or a police force, their insurable hours will be 35 insurable hours, unless you (as the employer) keep and provide the actual number of hours worked. </p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee works overtime hours</summary>
<p>If the employee works overtime hours, each hour of overtime work is treated as one hour of insurable employment. This is the case even if the rate of pay is higher.</p>
<p>Where the overtime hours are accumulated and your employee is paid for them at a later date (or on termination of their employment), the hours of insurable employment are the actual hours worked and not the hours accumulated at a rate greater than the regular one.</p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is called into work</summary>
<p>If your employee is called in to work, the insurable hours will be the number of hours paid.</p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is paid for stand-by hours</summary>
<p>If your employee is paid for stand-by hours, they are insurable if one of the following applies:
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The stand-by hours are paid at a rate equal to or above the rate paid for the hours your employee would have worked</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee is present at your (the employer)'s premises, waiting for you, as the employer, to request their services, as required under a contract of employment, and these hours are paid, regardless of the rate paid</li></ul></p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is paid for a public holiday</summary>
<p>If your employee is paid for work on a public holiday, each hour of work is treated as one hour of insurable employment. This is the case even if the rate of pay is higher. </p>
<p>When a public holiday is paid in straight time and your employee does not work on the holiday, the insurable hours are the hours your employee would normally have worked.</p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is on paid leave</summary>
<p>If your employee is on paid leave (vacation, paid sick leave or compensatory time off), the insurable hours are the number of hours of leave taken. </p></details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is paid remuneration with no hours attached</summary>
<p>No insurable hours are generated when the following amounts are paid:</p>
<ul class="colcount-md-2">
	<li>Vacation pay without actually taking any leave</li>
	<li>Bonus payments</li>
	<li>Gratuities</li>
	<li>Pay in lieu of termination notice</li>
</ul>
</details>
</li>
	
<li> <h3 id="step 2">Report your employee's insurable hours on a ROE</h3>
<p>You can issue your employee’s ROE using Service Canada’s online ROE web service, your payroll provider’s ROE Secure Automated Transmission or complete a paper ROE.</p>
<p>If you are issuing your employee’s ROE electronically, you have five calendar days after the end of the pay period in which your employee’s interruption of earning occurs to issue it. A different deadline may apply when filing on paper.</p>
<p>For guidance on how to complete and issue the ROE, go to Service Canada's guidance: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/reports/roe-guide.html">Employers: How to complete the record of employment (ROE) form</a></p>
<p>Employers who fail to issue an ROE to their employees as required are subject to a fine up to $2,000, prison for up to six months, or both. </p>
</li>
	
<li> <h3 id="step 3">Report the amounts paid on a T4 slip</h3>
<p>If you know that your employee will not be returning to work with you in the calendar year, CRA recommends that you calculate the employee’s income and the amounts of CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deducted and give your employee their T4 slip. The T4 slip must be included in your T4 return when you file it on or before the last day of February in the following year.</p>
<p>You must report the following amounts on your employee's T4 slip:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-lg"><li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"> </span> Box 14 - Employment income </li>
				    <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li  text-success"> </span> Box 24 - <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> insurable earnings</li>
				    <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li  text-success"> </span> Box 26 - <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>/<abbr title="Quebec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> pensionable earnings</li>
	 			    <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"> </span> Any applicable codes for taxable benefits</li>
 				  </ul>
