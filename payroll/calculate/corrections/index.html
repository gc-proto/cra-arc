<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Make corrections</h1>


<p>It is the obligation of the taxpayer, the employer and the payee to report the income accurately. The employer can correct a <strong>reporting error</strong>.</p>
<p> The employer <strong>cannot change the nature of the income paid </strong>(for example, from salary to dividends). This is considered retroactive tax planning and is viewed as inaccurately changing the reporting of the income.</p>

<h2 id="h_1">Current year corrections</h2>



<details><summary>You deducted more CPP contributions or EI premiums from the employee (overpayment)</summary>

<p>If you over deducted CPP or EI (for example, the maximum amount was exceeded, or the employee was not employed in pensionable/insurable employment) from an employee and you become aware of it in the <strong>current tax year: </strong></p>

<ol class="lst-stps">
<li>Reimburse the employee the amount deducted in error and adjust your payroll records to reflect the reduced deduction </li>
<li>Use the resulting credit in the payroll account to reduce future remittance in the <strong>same tax year</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Do not </strong>include the reimbursed amount on the T4 slip </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_2_1">What if you cannot reimburse the employee</h3>
<p>If the overdeduction <strong>cannot </strong>be reimbursed, you must report the total CPP or EI deductions and correct pensionable or insurable earnings on the employee's T4 slip.</p> 

<p>Learn more: <a href="../../after/correct.html">Correct prior year payroll deduction errors</a></p>
<p>The <strong>employee portion </strong>will be refunded when the employee files their personal income tax return.</p>
<h3 id="h_2_2">How to request a refund for the employer's share</h3>
<p>You can request a refund be sending a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/pd24.html">Form PD24, Application for a Refund of Overdeducted CPP Contributions or EI Premiums</a>. </p>
<p>Under the "statute barred" rules, you can request a refund for:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>CPP, up to <strong>four years </strong>after the end of the year in which it was deducted </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>EI, up to <strong>three years </strong>after the end of the year in which it was deducted </li>
</ul>
</details>

<details><summary>You under deducted CPP contributions or EI premiums from the employee (recovering)</summary>
<p>If you discover that you have under deducted CPP or EI, you are responsible for remitting the balance due for <strong>both </strong>the employer's and employee's shares.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_1">How to correct the error</h3>
<p>You can recover the employee's contributions or premiums from later payments to the employee, under the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>the recovered contribution or premium can be equal to, <strong>but not more than</strong>, the amount that should have been deducted from each payment </li>
<li>you <strong>cannot </strong>recover a contribution or a premium amount that has been outstanding for more than 12 months </li>
<li>you <strong>cannot </strong>adjust the employee's income tax deduction to cover the EI shortfall </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_3_2">What if you cannot recover the deduction in the current tax year</h3>
<p>If you should have made a deduction in a previous year and you recovered it through an additional deduction in the current year, <strong>do not </strong>report the recovered contributions or premiums on the current year's slip. </p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="../../after/correct.html">Correct prior year payroll deduction errors</a></p>

</details>

<details><summary>You deducted more or you under deducted income tax</summary>
<p>You may realize that the required amount of income tax was not deducted from amounts paid to your employee. </p>
<h3 id="h_4_1">How to correct the error</h3>
<p>You should advise your employee as soon as you know that the required required amount of income tax was not deducted. You can make an adjustment on a subsequent pay.</p>
