<p>You may need to correct the following deduction error or salary overpayment in the current tax year:</p>

<details><summary>You <strong>under deducted CPP contributions or EI premiums</strong> (recovering)</summary>
<p>If you discover that you have under deducted CPP or EI, you are responsible for remitting the balance due for <strong>both </strong>the employer's and employee's shares. If you do not remit the amount, you may receive a PIER review.</p>

<h3 id="h_3_1">How to correct the error</h3>
<p>You can recover the employee's contributions or premiums from later payments to the employee, under the following conditions:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The recovered contribution or premium can be <strong>equal to, but not more than</strong>, the amount that should have been deducted from each payment </li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>cannot </strong>adjust the employee's income tax deduction to <strong>cover the CPP or EI shortfall</strong> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_3_2">What if you cannot recover the deduction in the current tax year</h3>
<p>If you should have made a deduction in a previous year and you recovered it through an additional deduction in the current year, <strong>do not </strong>report the recovered contributions or premiums on the current year's slip. </p>

<h3 id="h_2_1">What if you cannot reimburse the employee</h3>
