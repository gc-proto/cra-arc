 <details>  <summary >What is an EPSP</summary>              
<div id="ajax-epsp"><p>An EPSP is an arrangement that allows an employer to share profits with all or a designated group of employees. Under an EPSP, amounts are paid to a trustee to be held and invested for the benefit of the employees who are beneficiaries of the plan.</p>
<p> Each year, the trustee is required to allocate to these beneficiaries all employer contributions, profits from trust property, capital gains and losses, and certain amounts in respect of forfeitures. </p>
<h4>How the employer can apply to have the arrangement qualify as an EPSP</h4>
<p>The employer must make an election with the CRA to have the arrangement qualify as an EPSP by sending all of the following information: </p>

 <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A letter from the employer stating that the employer elects to have the arrangement qualify as an EPSP </li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Not legally entitled to administer the corporation's affairs, a certified copy of the authorization to have the election made by the persons legally entitled to administer the corporation's affairs </li></ul></li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">A copy of the agreement and any supplementary agreement setting out the plan. </li>
