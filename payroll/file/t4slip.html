 <h4>Specific situations</h4>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">

<dt>Use of code 1 - T4 slips filed for calendar years 2023 and 2024 only</dt>
<dd><span class="label label-info">Health Canada administrative policy</span>  <p>To reduce the burden on employers, for calendar years 2023 and 2024 <strong>only</strong>, it is not mandatory to fill out box 45 <strong>when and only when</strong> code 1 is applicable.</p> 
<p>This administrative policy applies only if all reasonable efforts have been made to comply with the reporting requirements.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Third party filing T4 slips</dt>
<dd>Any third party organizations that complete T4 slips annually on behalf of their clients are required to complete this box. They are required to get the information from their clients and report it accurately on the T4 slip issued. </dd>

<dt>Union-offered dental coverage</dt>
<dd><p>If a union offers dental benefits to its members, without involvement of the employer or pension plan, the union is not considered their employer and will not be required to issue a T4 slip to report this benefit for their members or provide this information to the member’s employer.</p>
<p>However, if the employer or pension plan engages a union to deliver dental benefits to its employees, the employer must report it on the T4 slip.</p>
<p>If dental coverage is offered directly by the employer under a collective agreement (the employer is the sponsor of the plan or refunds the employees directly), the employer must report that coverage on its employee’s T4 slips. </p>
<p>A union must report  this benefit for its own employees or former employees. </p>

</dd>

<dt>Multiple T4 slips</dt>
<dd><p>If you file multiple T4 slips for an employee on various RP accounts of your single business number, you need to consistently report on all slips what coverage was offered on December 31 of that year.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, you may choose to report according to each RP account separately. </p></dd>

<dt>More than 6 codes in "Other information"</dt>
<dd>If more than 6 codes in "Other information" apply to the same employee and you have to use an additional T4 slip (overflow slip), the same code should be used for all overflow slips for the same employee.</dd>

<dt>Employee declines dental coverage</dt>
<dd><p>An employer must report whether the employee is offered dental coverage, not whether the employee has chosen to use it, opted out, or refused coverage. If dental benefits were offered, you must report that the employees were offered dental benefits and what level of coverage according to the codes provided. </p></dd>

<dt>Employee leaves employment before December 31 of the taxation year</dt>
<dd><p>If, on December 31 of the taxation year, the employee was no longer eligible for dental insurance offered by you (because they no longer worked for your company or for any other reason), fill out box 45 using code 1 “Not eligible to access any dental care insurance, or coverage of dental services of any kind.”. </p></dd>

<dt>Health Spending Accounts (HSAs) and allowances for dental expenses </dt>
<dd><p>If you provide your employee with an allowance to cover dental services or insurance that covers dental insurance, you must  report the extent of that coverage using the applicable code in box 45. If the health spending account or allowance does not cover dental services or include dental insurance, it is not considered providing access to dental services and you can fill out box 45 using code 1. </p></dd>

<dt>Employer negotiated group rate</dt>
<dd><p>If your employee has access to an employer-negotiated group rate because of their employment with you, you must report the report the extent of the coverage using box 45.  </p></dd>
