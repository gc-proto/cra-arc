<dt>Use of code 1 - T4A slips filed for calendar years 2023 and 2024 only</dt>
<dd><span class="label label-info">Health Canada administrative policy</span>  <p>To reduce the burden on payers, for calendar years 2023 and 2024 <strong>only</strong>, it is not mandatory to fill out box 015 <strong>when and only when</strong> code 1 is applicable. </p>
<p>This administrative policy applies only if all reasonable efforts have been made to comply with the reporting requirements.</p>

<dt>Third party filing T4A slips</dt>
<dd>Any third party organizations or pension plan administrators that complete T4A slips annually on behalf of their clients are required to complete this box (if nothing is reported in <a href="#bx016">box 016</a>, reporting is optional). They are required to get the information from their clients and report it accurately on the T4A slip issued.</dd>

<dt>Union-offered dental coverage</dt>
<dd>If a union offers dental benefits to its members, without involvement of the employer or pension plan, the union is not considered their employer and will not be required to issue a T4A slip to report this benefit for their members or provide this information to the member’s employer or former employer. </p>
<p>However, if the employer or pension plan engages a union to deliver dental benefits to its employees or former employees, then the pension plan must report it on the T4A slip.</p> 
<p>If the dental coverage is offered directly by an employer under a collective agreement (the employer is the named sponsor of the plan or refunds the employees directly), the pension plan must report the coverage on the former employees’ T4A slips.</p>
 <p>A union will have to report this benefit for its own employees or former employees. </p></dd>

<dt>More than 6 codes in "Other information"</dt>
<dd>If more than 6 codes in "Other information" apply to the same recipient and you have to use an additional T4A slip (overflow slip), the same code should be used for all overflow slips for the same recipient.</dd>

<dt>Recipient declines dental coverage</dt>
<dd> <p>A payer must report whether the recipient is offered dental benefits, not whether the recipient has chosen to use it, opted out, or refused coverage. If dental benefits were offered, you must report that the former employees were offered and what level of coverage according to the codes provided. </p></dd>
