 <h2 id="h_4">When a payment is considered received on time</h2>
<p>We consider your payment made on the day that it is:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>Processed </strong>at any Canadian financial institution </li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>Received </strong>at the CRA </li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to all payment methods, including by mail and by third-party service providers. If you are using these services, you must clearly understand their terms and conditions.</p>

<p>When a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday</a> recognized by the CRA, your payment is considered on time if the CRA receives it or if it is postmarked on or before the next business day.</p>

 <h2 id="h_5">How to change your remitter type</h2>

<p>You can request us to review your account and confirm your remitter type and frequency in writing if:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">You are a regular remitter and all of the following apply:
<ul>
<li>You have had your account for 12 months or more </li>
<li>You meet the conditions to be a quarterly remitter, small employer</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col-50">You are an accelerated remitter, and using last year's AMWA would lower your remitting frequency </li>
</ul>
<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">To request a review, call <strong>1-800-959-5525</strong>.</p>


<h2 id="h_3">What happens if your cheque is returned or your financial institution refuses to process</h2>
<p>We will charge a fee of up to $25 for each cheque that is returned for <strong>any</strong> of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-sufficient funds (NSF) </li>
<li>Closed account </li>
<li>Stopped payments </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="h_2">What if you remit (pay) late or you do not make a payment</h2>
<p>We will apply a penalty and charge interest.</p>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Penalty</h3>
<p>We will charge you a penalty when you deduct amounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Over $500, but do not send them to us </li>
<li>Over $500, but send them to us late </li>
<li>Under $500, and knowingly or under circumstances of gross negligence do not send them to us or send them late </li>
</ul>
<p>The penalty is:</p>

<ul>
<li>3% if the amount is one to three days late </li>
<li>5% if it is four or five days late </li>
<li>7% if it is six or seven days late </li>
<li>10% if it is more than seven days late, or if no amount is remitted </li>
<li>20% if this is the second or subsequent time you are assessed this penalty in a calendar year, if the failures were made knowingly or under circumstances of gross negligence</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example: When a remittance is considered late</summary>
<p>A remittance that was due in January of the current year (for deductions made in December of the previous year) is considered late when paid with the previous year's information return (T4, T4A) and this return is filed after the remittance due date.</p></details>
<h3 id="h_1_2">Interest</h3>
<p>If you do not pay an amount that is due, we may apply interest from the day the payment was due. We:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the interest rate every calendar quarter, based on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rates</a> </li>
<li>Compound the interest daily</li>
<li>Apply interest to unpaid penalties </li>
</ul>
<p>The interest rates are announced in the month preceding each calendar quarter.</p>
