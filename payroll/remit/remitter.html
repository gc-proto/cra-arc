<h3 id="h_1_1">How the CRA determines your remitter type</h3>
<p>Generally, your remitter type is based on your <strong>average monthly withholding amount (AMWA)</strong> from two calendar years ago.</p>
<div id="ajax-amwa">
<p>The AMWA is calculated by:</p>

<p>Every November, the CRA conducts a review of all payroll accounts to determine remitter types.</p>
<p>If your remitter type changes, they will let you know in writing. If applicable, the CRA will also look at your compliance record to see if you qualify as a quarterly remitter.</p>


<h3 id="h_1_2">If you have more than one payroll account</h3>
<p>If your organization has more than one payroll account, your remitter type will be the same for all accounts.</p>
<h3 id="h_1_3">If you are an associated corporation</h3>
<p>If you are an associated corporation, your remitter type is the same as that of all your associated corporations.</p>

<details><summary>Example: Regular corporation</summary> 
<p>In 2021, Company A had to remit $1,050,000 over 10 months. It is not an associated corporation. Company A's AMWA is calculated as follows: $1,050,000 ÷ 10 = $105,000.</p>
<p>Since its AMWA was over $99,999.99 in 2021, Company A will be a <a href="#h_7">threshold 2 accelerated remitter</a> for 2023.</p>
</details>
<details><summary> Example: Associated corporation</summary> 
<p>Companies X and Y are associated corporations. In 2021, their combined source deductions remittances were $297,000. Each corporation had to remit for January through November. Since months are counted only once, their AMWA is calculated as follows: $297,000 ÷ 11 = $27,000.</p>
<p>Since their combined AMWA was between $25,000.00 and $99,999.99 in 2021, each company will be a <a href="#h_6">threshold 1 accelerated remitter</a> for 2023.</p>
</details>

<h3 id="h_1_4"> Remitter type has no impact on pay periods</h3>

<p>Your remitter type is not related to your pay periods. If your remitter type changes, you do not have to start paying your employees more often because you have to remit on different due dates.</p>


<h2 id="h_3">Quarterly remitters - New small employers</h2>
<div id="ajax-quarter1">
<p>A new employer is an employer whose payroll account has been open for less than <strong>12 months</strong>. You do not have to apply. Remit quarterly unless the CRA tells you, on your statement of account, that you have to remit at a different frequency.</p>
<p>New employers are eligible to be a quarterly remitter if they meet <strong>both </strong>of the following conditions:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The monthly withholding amount (MWM) is less than <strong>$1,000</strong>
<details class="mrgn-bttm-md"><summary>What is the "monthly withholding amount (MWA)"</summary>
<p>The Monthly withholding amount (MWA) is the total of all required remittances in one calendar month.</p>
</details></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A perfect compliance record is maintained on all payroll and GST/HST accounts </li>
</ul>

<p>A new employer who no longer qualifies to be a quarterly remitter will be considered a regular remitter in the <strong>next </strong>calendar quarter.</p>

<details><summary> Example: MWA condition is not met</summary> 
<p>Zach's Auto Repairs has a MWA of $500 for January, $1,500 for February, and $1,500 for March. The employer's quarterly remittance of $3,500 is due by April 15.</p>
<p>Since the MWA for February and March was $1,000 or more, the employer will be considered a regular remitter as of the beginning of the second calendar quarter. The employer will have to remit monthly beginning with their MWA for the month of April, which is due by May 15.</p>
</details>

<h3>Perfect compliance record</h3> 
<p>Quarterly remitters <strong>must </strong>meet <strong>all </strong>of the following conditions <strong>over the previous 12 months </strong>to maintain a perfect compliance record in their payroll and GST/HST accounts:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The payroll account <strong>must </strong>have:
<ul>
<li>No late remittances or late remitting penalties (LRP) </li>
<li>No failure to remit (FTR) penalties </li>
<li>No failure to deduct (FTD) penalties </li>
<li>No overdue T4-type information return(s) </li>
</ul></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the employer has a GST/HST account, it <strong>must </strong>have:
<ul>
<li>No balance owing </li>
<li>No overdue returns </li>
<li>No credit balance with a refund hold </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Example: Perfect compliance record condition is not met</summary> 
<p>ABC Construction has a MWA of $500 for each of the months January, February and March. Where April 15 is not a holiday and the employer remits their quarterly remittance of $1,500 after April 15, the remittance is considered late.</p>
<p>Since the failure happened in April, ABC Construction may make their quarterly remittance for April, May and June by July 15. However, the company will have to remit monthly beginning with their MWA for the month of July, which is due by August 15.</p>
</details>
