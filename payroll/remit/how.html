<h2 id="h-6">How to make a payment at a Canadian financial institution</h2>
<p>You must use an <strong>original </strong>paper remittance voucher to make a payment at a Canadian financial institution.</p>
<p>Each voucher has a micro encoding feature required to process the payment. For this reason, <strong>photocopies and faxes are not accepted</strong>.</p>
<p>You must remit by the due date even if you do not have a remittance voucher. </p>
