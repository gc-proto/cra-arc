        <h2 id="h-1">About free  tax clinics</h2>
        <p>The  Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) has existed since 1971 and is a  longstanding partnership between the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and community  organizations and their volunteers. </p>
        <p>Participating  organizations host free tax clinics where volunteers complete income tax and  benefit returns for eligible individuals to ensure they receive, or continue to  receive, the benefit and credit payments they are entitled to. As a result,  your organization and its volunteers help improve the quality of life of those  in your community who need it the most.</p>
        <p>In  the province of Quebec, the program is referred to as the <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/one-mission-concrete-actions/helping-you-meet-your-obligations/income-tax-assistance-volunteer-program/">Income Tax Assistance – Volunteer Program</a> (ITAVP). It is administered jointly by  the CRA and Revenu Québec<a name="_Hlk204758225">. ITAVP organizations host  free tax clinics where volunteers prepare both the federal and provincial  return for eligible individuals free of charge. </a></p>
        <p>Organizations  that host free tax clinics include non-profits, charities, municipalities,  libraries, senior residences, and community associations, among others. Some  examples include:</p>
        <ul class="colcount-md-2">
          <li>Seniors&rsquo; support and recreation  centres</li>
          <li>Shelters and support centres</li>
          <li>Family services associations</li>
          <li>Settlement organizations</li>
          <li>Multicultural societies</li>
          <li>Service clubs (i.e., the Lion&rsquo;s Club,  and the Royal Canadian Legion)</li>
          <li>Band offices</li>
          <li>Volunteer bureaus</li>
          <li>Post-secondary student groups or  associations</li>
          <li>Places of worship</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These  organizations provide services to the community and usually have the  infrastructure in place to support the CVITP.</p>
        <p> Some  organizations offer a full-service tax clinic—looking after volunteers and managing clinic  operations—while  others simply provide the space. Your organization can decide what type and  frequency of services you wish to offer and can choose to host in-person or  virtual tax clinics. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 id="h-2">How free tax clinics help</h2>
    <p>Each  year, CVITP organizations and volunteers help hundreds of thousands of people  file their income tax and benefit returns.</p>
    <p> Individuals  need to do their taxes every year to qualify for many federal, provincial, and  municipal programs and services. This is a difficult and sometimes overwhelming  task for many people in need.</p>
    <p> CVITP  tax preparation services are offered <strong>free of charge</strong> to  everyone who meets the eligibility criteria and includes completing taxes for  current and previous years.</p>
    <p> The CVITP  officers support and guide community organizations as they deliver the program.</p>
    <p> Organizations  and volunteers <strong>cannot</strong> charge for their services and <strong>must</strong> decline  any offers of monetary reward. Anyone who charges a fee for their services will  be removed from the program.</p>
    <h2 id="h-3">Eligibility criteria</h2>
    <p>In  order to be eligible for help at a free tax clinic, individuals must have a <strong>both</strong> a <strong>modest income</strong> and a <strong>simple tax situation</strong>.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <details>
          <summary>What is a "modest income"</summary>
          <p>The  following table provides a guideline to determine what is considered a modest  income. In general, a modest income means the total family income is less than  or equal to the amount shown in the chart below, based on the size of the  family.</p>
          <p> Community  organizations can adjust the total family income for their clients based on the  local economic environment, the population they serve, and their resources.  Organizations may also create additional criteria for the community they serve.  If a host organization chooses to modify the family income amounts for their  tax clinic, they should include details when posting clinic information on  Canada.ca. </p>
          <p>Family size includes an  individual, or a couple, and their dependants.</p>

          <summary>What is a "simple tax situation"</summary>
          <p>As  a participating CVITP organization, you can offer to file both current and  prior year tax returns for individuals with a simple tax situation. In general,  a tax situation is simple if an individual has no income or if their  income comes from these sources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Employment</li>
            <li>Pension</li>
            <li>Benefits,       such as the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, disability insurance,       employment insurance, and social assistance</li>
            <li>Registered       Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs)</li>
            <li>Scholarships,       fellowships, bursaries, or grants</li>
            <li>Interest (under       $1,200 )</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The  CVITP does <strong>not</strong> provide training or support for complex tax  situations. Volunteers should <strong>not</strong> complete returns with the  following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-employment income or employment expenses (refer to <sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Exception </span>1</a></sup>) </li>

    <h3>Limited role for volunteers</h3>
    <p>Volunteers       are not expected to answer complex tax questions. If a taxpayer needs       information that is beyond the volunteer&rsquo;s expertise, they should go       to <strong>canada.ca/taxes</strong> or call <strong>1-800-959-8281</strong>.</p>
    <p>Volunteers       should only complete tax returns they feel comfortable preparing based on       the information the taxpayer gives them.</p>
    <h2 id="h-4">How the program works</h2>
    <p>The  CVITP is a collaboration between community organizations and the Canada Revenue  Agency (CRA). Community organizations plan and schedule their tax clinics and  recruit volunteers. They have the flexibility to decide <strong>when and how often</strong> to host their free tax clinics, whether year-round or only during tax season. </p>
    <p> The  duration of their clinics is based on each organization&rsquo;s capacity and the  needs of their community. An organization can host tax clinics at several  locations and offer varying sessions and schedules at each clinic.</p>
    <p>Free tax  clinics can be offered:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-shoe-prints fa-li"></span>On a walk-in basis;</li>
      <li><span class="far fa-calendar fa-li"></span>By appointment;</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-envelope-open-text fa-li"></span>By drop-off and pick-up;</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-headset fa-li"></span>Virtually, which serves eligible individuals:
        <ul>
          <li>in a province/territory</li>
          <li>in Northern communities in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-25500-northern-residents-deductions/line-25500-places-located-prescribed-zones.html">prescribed zones</a></li>
        </ul>
        <details class="mrgn-lft-md mrgn-tp-sm">
          <summary class="max-content">What are virtual tax clinics</summary>
          <p>An  organization can also offer its services virtually to eligible individuals  within the same province or territory at a scheduled time by video conference  or by phone. For those living in Northern communities (prescribed zones), the  volunteer may or may not be located within the same province or territory.</p>
        </details>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The  following factors may help in determining the types of clinics an organization  chooses to run:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The space available </li>
      <li>The number of volunteers involved</li>
      <li>The number of people in your community       that need help</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Support the CRA offers</h3>
    <p> The  CVITP is committed to helping people with modest incomes and simple tax  situations file their taxes free of charge, so that they can receive the  benefit and credit payments they may be entitled to. CRA supports both  participating organizations and volunteers by: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>offering guidance       and support to organizations;</li>
      <li>providing       training for volunteers;</li>
      <li>offering       a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/grant.html">grant</a> for hosting free tax clinics;</li>
      <li>providing       free tax preparation software;</li>
      <li>operating a       year-round dedicated help line for volunteers;</li>
      <li>providing       promotional material;</li>
      <li>donating       used laptops to eligible organizations (quantities limited);</li>
      <li>providing       volunteers, who meet certain requirements, access to the CRA&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/volunteer.html">EFILE</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/about-auto-fill-return.html">Auto-fill my return services</a>; and </li>
      <li>promoting CVITP       tax clinics on Canada.ca. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h-5">Organization&rsquo;s responsibilities</h2>
    <p>All CVITP organizations must be located in  Canada in order to host free tax clinics in Canada. In addition, organizations  must ensure that their regular business activities are clearly separated from  any CVITP-related activities.</p>
    <p>As a participating organization, you are  responsible for:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">

    <p> The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) reserves the  right to suspend any organization that violates the program terms or conditions  of use, does not meet their responsibilities, or is involved in any disreputable conduct that would  reflect adversely on the program. </a></p>

    <h2 id="h-6">Register your organization</h2>
    <p>Your  organization must register with the CVITP every year to participate in the  program. </p>
    <p> To avoid delays, register your organization in  late October to be ready for tax season. The program runs year-round but most clinics are  busiest during tax season (late February to early May).</p>
    <p> After  you complete the registration, a CVITP officer will contact you to ensure you  have all the information you need to host a free tax clinic.</p>
