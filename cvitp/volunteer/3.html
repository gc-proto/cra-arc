    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Those who wish to participate as volunteers in CVITP activities must  register as a volunteer and accept the program terms and conditions of use. If you are a returning volunteer, you will  need to enter your <strong>Volunteer Identification Number (VIN)</strong> when  registering for the program.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span><strong>Be affiliated with a CVITP community organization</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>To participate in the program, you must  be affiliated with a participating organization. If you need help finding an  organization to affiliate with, a CVITP officer can assist in making  connections; however, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are  affiliated.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span><strong>Meet requirements based on your role</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>CVITP volunteers must meet the requirements of  their role before they can participate by taking certain steps.&nbsp;Once you have met all the necessary requirements, you will  receive a CVITP participation  approval email. </li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span><strong>Be 18 years of  age or older to prepare and file tax returns</strong><strong> </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no age  limit for volunteering with the CVITP; however you must be&nbsp;18 years of age  or older to prepare and file tax returns. Volunteers under 18 years  old&nbsp;can participate in a supporting role only. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you become a volunteer, you are  expected to:&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Comply with the CVITP program terms and conditions</strong><strong> of use as  outlined on the </strong><strong>registration  form</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Complete CVITP training</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li>CVITP volunteers are strongly encouraged to complete training every year  and follow the up-to-date CVITP procedures and guidelines outlined in the  training.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Keep taxpayer information secure and confidential</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li>It is critical to the program's success  to ensure organizations and volunteers safeguard taxpayer information <strong>and</strong> understand their responsibilities in this respect, as outlined in the training.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><a name="_Hlk197939975">Return all copies and  original documents back to the taxpayer.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete all electronic  documents containing taxpayer information. </li>
    <li><strong>Provide services free of charge</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li>You cannot charge for your volunteer services and <strong>must</strong> decline  any offers of monetary reward. Anyone charging a fee will be removed from the  program and their CVITP EFILE account will be suspended. If you encounter a  situation where fees are being charged, bring it to the attention of your CVITP officer immediately.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Identify yourself as a volunteer</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Always identify yourself as a CVITP volunteer. You must not present  yourself as an employee or a representative of the CRA or Revenu Québec, even  if you are one.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Avoid a conflict of interest</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Do not create a conflict of interest between your work as a volunteer  and your private or business activities. Never promote your private or business  activities to individuals you serve through the CVITP. If you have an EFILE  number for professional use, you must get a separate EFILE number as a  volunteer for the CVITP.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Act professionally and respectfully</strong>&nbsp; </li>
    <li>CVITP volunteers are expected to conduct  themselves in a professional manner. You are also expected to respect the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/"><em>Canadian  Human Rights Act</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/index.html"><em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em></a>. You must respect all CVITP  participants regardless of race, disability, sexual orientation, gender  identity, marital status, age, or religion.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Protect your EFILE credentials</strong></li>
    <li>Do not share your EFILE number or password.</li>
    <li>Do not use someone else&rsquo;s EFILE number  to file returns. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br>
    CVITP volunteers must comply with the  program terms and conditions of use, fulfil their responsibilities, and  immediately inform CVITP officers if they are unable to do so.<strong></strong><br>
