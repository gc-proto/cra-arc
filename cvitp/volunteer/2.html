  <details>
    <summary>What a tax  preparer does </summary>
    <p id="tax-preparer"> As a volunteer tax preparer,  you will complete taxes for people who meet the <a href="../organization.html#h-3">eligibility criteria</a> of a modest income and a  simple tax situation. You can file returns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>electronically</strong>&nbsp;using EFILE and&nbsp;the CVITP&nbsp;tax preparation software; </li>
      <li>by&nbsp;<strong>paper;  or</strong></li>
      <li><strong>both methods.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CRA offers training and  support, but if you file electronically, you should be comfortable using a  computer and have a basic understanding of how to do taxes. <strong>You must be 18 years of age  or older to participate as a tax preparer.</strong> </p>
    <p>You  may not meet the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers/eligibility.html#sccr">EFILE screening requirements</a> if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you do not have a social insurance  number (SIN), and</li>
      <li>you have not filed a return in Canada. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, you may still file by paper (if you are 18  years of age or older) or volunteer in a <a href="#support">support role</a> . </p>
    <p><strong>You must  meet all of the requirements for the role you have selected in order to be  approved to participate with the program.</strong> Some community organizations may assign  one role to each volunteer, while others may assign multiple roles to one volunteer.</p>
    <p> Most organizations are looking for tax  preparers.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What a supporting role does</summary>
    <p id="support"> Volunteers in support roles  provide general assistance and do not prepare or file tax returns. You may or  may not have access to taxpayer&rsquo;s personal information such as identifying  information (e.g., name, address, and social insurance number, income  information, tax slips, or other documents including completed tax returns).<br>
      Support roles include the  following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Greeter</strong>: is the taxpayer&rsquo;s first point of contact at  in-person clinics.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpreter</strong>: facilitates communication  between the taxpayer and volunteer by acting as a translator.</li>
      <li><strong>Screener</strong>: ensures taxpayers have the  required paperwork and helps organize documents. Screeners may also help to  ensure taxpayers meet program eligibility criteria.</li>
      <li><strong>Administrator</strong>: schedules appointments,  makes follow-up calls, books space for tax clinics, and performs other  administrative tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>The primary contact of the  organization is also known as a <strong>Coordinator</strong>. As a coordinator, you will  communicate with the CRA, assist volunteers, organize and schedule tax clinics,  prepare and/or file returns, review tax information, and distribute software  activation keys. The coordinator may participate in a<strong> support role and/or as  a tax preparer</strong>.</p>
  </details>
  <h2 id="h-2">Requirements</h2>
  <p>To participate in the program, you <strong>must be affiliated with an  organization</strong>. You do not need to be an employee  or a member of the organization; your  connection can be solely as a volunteer for their clinic. If you need help  finding an organization to affiliate with after you register, a CVITP officer  can assist in making connections, however, it is your responsibility to ensure that  you are affiliated.</p>
  <p>Please note that the number of  organizations in need of volunteers is limited in some regions.</p>
  <p>Depending on your role, you <strong>may be required to obtain additional documentation</strong>:
    </h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Police  records check</summary>
    <p>A police records check (PRC) is a background check  issued through any police service, including municipal and regional police  forces, or through a private company that provides personal background checks.  Typically, there is a cost associated with obtaining a PRC; however, your  organization may be able to provide you with a letter that will waive or reduce  the fees.</p>
    <p>For  the CVITP, police records checks are considered valid if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>they were       issued within three years of the start of the program year (January 1); and</li>
      <li>they do not       contain any information that conflicts with the program&rsquo;s terms and       conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you get your police records check, provide it to your  affiliated community organization. The organization will confirm they have  received it and that it is valid with the CVITP officer.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Use of CRA's EFILE service</summary>
    <p>EFILE is an automated  service that allows CVITP volunteers and other approved tax preparation service  providers to electronically transmit individuals' tax returns to the CRA using an  EFILE-certified software. <br>
      To electronically file returns as a&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;volunteer, you must apply for an  EFILE number or renew your existing EFILE account. Submit your EFILE  application or renewal early as it could take up to <strong>30 business days</strong> to  process. </p>
    <ul >
      <li>Volunteers should never share their       EFILE number and password with anyone or use another volunteer's EFILE       number and password.</li>
      <li>Accountants and professional tax       preparers must obtain a separate EFILE number to electronically file       returns under the CVITP.</li>
      <li>Only volunteers who intend to       transmit tax returns electronically should apply for or renew their EFILE       account. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the       suspension of your EFILE number.</li>
      <li>All EFILE registrations or renewals       require a <a href="#repid">RepID</a>. </li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Getting a RepID</summary>
    <p id="repid"> A representative identifier  (RepID) is a unique&nbsp;<strong>seven-character alphanumeric code&nbsp;</strong>that  identifies a volunteer as a representative for a taxpayer. <br>
      All registrations or renewals  of an EFILE number require a RepID.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If you already have a RepID, you must provide it       when you register/renew your account.</li>
      <li>If you do not have a RepID, you can obtain one by       registering with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a       Client</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Optional electronic services for tax  preparers</strong><br>
      Volunteers participating in  the tax preparer role who are filing electronically can choose to use the Auto-fill  my return (AFR) and Represent a Client (RAC) electronic services.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Auto-fill my return - </strong>A secure online service that       automatically fills in parts of a taxpayer&rsquo;s federal income tax and       benefit return. It uses information that the CRA has available at the time       of filing. This service can be used by CVITP volunteers when completing       returns for 2017 and onward. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The&nbsp;CRA&nbsp;encourages  the use of Auto-fill my return because it reduces the margin for error and  helps ensure accuracy. It also improves service to taxpayers who may not have  copies of their tax slips.<br>
      If you intend to use Auto-fill my return, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>include your representative identification number  (RepID) in your&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;volunteer registration. If  your&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;registration was completed without it, you can still  provide your RepID to your&nbsp;CVITP officer at a later date;</li>
      <li>apply for a&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;EFILE number or renew  your existing EFILE account;</li>
      <li>provide your organization with a valid <a href="#_A_Police_record">police records check</a>; and</li>
      <li>use the UFILE&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;tax software.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Represent a Client - </strong>An online portal that allows       authorized representatives to securely access tax-related information on       behalf of individuals. Everyone who registers with Represent a Client will       receive a RepID.</li>
