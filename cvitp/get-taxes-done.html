        <h3>Determine if you are eligible</h3>
        <p>To be eligible to use the services of a free tax clinic, you <strong>must have both</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A modest income</li>
          <li>A simple tax situation</li>

            <h4>Determine if you have a modest income</h4>
            <p>The following table provides a guideline to determine what is considered a modest income.</p>
            <p>In general, a modest income means the total family income is less than or equal to the amount shown in the chart below, based on the size of the family.</p>
            <p>Family size includes an individual, or a couple, and their dependants.</p>
            <p>Community organizations can adjust the total family income for their clients based on the local economic environment, the population they serve, and their resources.</p>

            <h4>Determining if you have a simple tax situation</h4>
            <p>In general, a tax situation is simple if an individual has no income or if their income comes from these sources:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Employment</li>
              <li>Pension</li>
              <li>Benefits, such as the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, disability insurance, employment insurance, and social assistance</li>
              <li>Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs)</li>
              <li>Scholarships, fellowships, bursaries, or grants</li>
              <li>Interest (under $1,200)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Volunteers are not expected to answer complex tax questions. If a taxpayer needs information that is beyond the volunteer’s expertise, they can find more information on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes.html">website</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the Canada Revenue Agency</a>. </p>
            <p>Some volunteers may complete prior-year tax returns; however, they will only complete tax returns they feel comfortable preparing based on the information the taxpayer gives them. </p>

              <p>Tax information slips are prepared by your employer, payer, or  administrator. You should have received most of your slips and receipts by the  end of February.

              <p> A volunteer may also be able to retrieve some of your tax slips  through the CRA&rsquo;s online Auto-fill my return feature. This feature allows a  volunteer to retrieve any tax slips that the CRA has available at the time of  the request. Please note that not all volunteers are able to access this online  feature. </p>
              <p> If you need a slip for an earlier year, you may be able to get a  copy through <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Account</a> or by speaking to one of our agents  at <span class="nowrap">1-800-959-8281</span>. </p>
