  <li>Generally, a volunteer should not prepare returns  for individuals who sold their property. CVITP volunteers can prepare returns  for individuals who have sold a property <strong>only</strong> if:</li>
  <li>the <strong>entire</strong> property is designated as their principal residence for all years  that they owned it</li>
  <li>the individual  never reported any rental income (or loss) generated from the property</li>
  <li>When an individual sells their principal residence, any capital gain from that  sale is not taxable because of the principal residence exemption.</li>
  <li>The individual must report the sale and designate their property as their principal  residence on Schedule 3 and form T2091 – Designation of a property as a  principal residence.</li>
  <li>You need the following information from the individual to report and  designate the sale of their principal residence:
  <ul>
    <li>the  date of  acquisition </li>
    <li>the date of  disposition </li>
    <li>the proceeds of  disposition </li>
    <li>the address of  the principal residence</li>
    <li>the percentage  of co-ownership if owned jointly with another person (individuals normally  co-own 50% with their spouse or common-law partner)</li>

  <li>Generally, a volunteer does not prepare returns for individuals who have  self-employment or business income, unless they meet the CVITP eligibility  criteria.

  <li>If an individual has a T4A information slip that has Fees&nbsp;for services  in <strong>box 048</strong>, this amount is reported  as self-employment or business income and is taxable. When reported, it is  mandatory to include form T2125, Statement of Business or Professional  Activities with the return. </li>
  <li>The North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is mandatory and must be entered in form T2125. The individual must give  you sufficient information so you can find the correct <strong>six digit</strong> <a href="http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=307532">NAICS  code</a>.</li>
  <li>In order for the software to report the income correctly and to generate  form T2125, you must enter the income in two different places. First, as  business income, then as income from a T4A slip. This does not duplicate the  income in the tax return. </li>

  <li>The northern residents is calculated on form T2222 and claimed on line  25500.</li>
  <li>To claim northern residents deductions, an individual must have lived  permanently, in a prescribed zone (Zone A or Zone B), for at least  six&nbsp;consecutive months, beginning or ending in the tax year for which you  are preparing the return.</li>
  <li>If the individual has not lived in a prescribed zone for at least  six&nbsp;consecutive months at the time of completing their return, they do not  yet qualify. You can complete the individual's return without making the claim  and, when they qualify,&nbsp;they can ask the CRA to adjust their return.</li>
  <li>To determine whether the individual&rsquo;s residence is in Zone A or Zone B, go  to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-25500-northern-residents-deductions.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_taxes-northern-residents" target="_blank">Line 25500 - Northern residents deductions</a> and click <strong>Places located in prescribed zones</strong>.</li>
  <li>There are two northern residents deductions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the  residency deduction</li>
    <li>the  travel deduction</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The<strong> residency deduction</strong> is for having lived in a prescribed zone  and is made up of two parts:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>the basic residency amount</strong> can be claimed for the number of days in the year that the  individual lived in a prescribed zone </li>
    <li><strong>the additional residency amount </strong>can be claimed for the same number of days  that were used to calculate the individual&rsquo;s basic residency amount if they  are the <strong>only</strong> person claiming the  basic residency amount for the dwelling that they lived in during that period.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <strong>travel deduction</strong> is for  costs related to travel that started from a prescribed zone and is made up of  two parts:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>medical travel</strong> (unlimited trips in the year) </li>
    <li><strong>other travel</strong> (limited to two trips per year, per person) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Under proposed changes, the taxpayer or an eligible  family member must have taken the trip, even if neither received a taxable travel  benefit for that trip.</p>
<p>Individuals can claim a deduction for travel benefits even if they are <strong>not</strong> claiming a residency deduction. For example, if an individual&rsquo;s spouse or  common-law partner claims both the basic and the additional residency amounts,  the individual can still claim a travel deduction. </p>
<ul>
  <li>To calculate the travel deduction for each trip, the individual can use one  of the following:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>the value of the taxable travel benefit       received from employment (if any)</li>
  <li>under proposed changes, a portion of the       $1,200 standard amount (this is an amount per person, not per trip) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>For each trip, the software will automatically claim the <strong>lowest of the  following three amounts</strong>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the value of the taxable travel benefit  received from employment (if any) or, under proposed changes, the portion of  the individual's or their eligible family member's $1,200 standard amount that  is allocated to the trip</li>
    <li>the total travel expenses paid for the trip  using either the detailed or simplified calculation methods </li>
    <li>the lowest cost quoted for a flight from  the airport closest to the individual&rsquo;s residence to the nearest designated  city (even if they did not actually travel by air or to that city). It is the individual's responsibility to  get the quote for the lowest return air fare. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>An individual cannot claim a travel deduction if <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>they or their eligible family member  received or was entitled to receive non-taxable amounts as travel assistance,  travel allowance, or reimbursement for travel expenses</li>
    <li>someone else has already claimed the  deduction for travel benefits for this trip on their return</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the individual is claiming a deduction for medical travel on form T2222,  no one can claim it as a medical expense on their return.</li>

<h3>Lines  31600 and 31800 Disability tax credit (T2201)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The disability tax credit (DTC) is a non-refundable tax credit that helps  persons with disabilities or their supporting family members reduce the amount  of income tax they may have to pay.</li>
  <li>The DTC includes a supplement for persons who are under 18 years of age at  the end of the year.</li>
  <li>To claim the disability amount, the individual must have  an approved form T2201 Disability Tax Credit  Certificate on file with the CRA. </li>
  <li>Eligibility criteria to claim the DTC from a dependant on line 31800  require that the dependant:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>was resident in Canada at some point in the  tax year</li>
    <li>depended on the individual for some or all  of the basic necessities of life (food, shelter, or clothing)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In addition, one of the following conditions must be met:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the individual claimed or could have  claimed an amount on line 30400 for the dependant, if the individual did not  have a spouse or common-law partner, and if the dependant did not have any  income</li>
    <li>the individual claimed or could have  claimed an amount on line 30450 for the dependant, if the dependant had no  income and had been 18 years of age or older in 2021</li>
  </ul>
  <li>An individual cannot claim the disability amount transferred from a  dependant for:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>a child for whom they had to pay child  support</li>
    <li>a person whose spouse or common-law partner  claimed the disability amount transferred from a spouse or any other  non-refundable tax credit (other than a credit for medical expenses) for that  person with a disability</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the individual or anyone else paid for attendant care  or for care in a facility, the individual may be able to claim the DTC and the  amount paid as medical expenses. Refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4065/medical-expenses.html#chrt">Claiming  both attendant care as medical expenses and the disability amount, and the  certification needed</a>.</li>
  <li>The software will automatically claim the maximum amount (including the  supplement for persons who are under 18) and claim it on line 31600 –  Disability amount for self.</li>
  <li>If the individual with the disability does not need the full amount of this  credit to reduce their tax owing, the software will automatically transfer the  remaining amount as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>on line 31800 – Disability amount  transferred from a dependant</li>
    <li>on line 32600 – Amounts transferred from  your spouse or common-law partner </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>T2201 Disability Tax Credit Certificate</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate can be submitted online or by mail and must be completed  by a medical practitioner,&nbsp;confirming that the individual had a severe and  prolonged impairment in physical or mental function during the taxation year. </li>
  <li>If an individual is claiming the DTC and they do not already have an  approved T2201 on file for the year with CRA, it is in the individual&rsquo;s best  interest to submit the return without claiming the DTC and send the T2201 form  separately.</li>
  <li>The T2201 form has a section allowing the individual to specify whether  they would like the CRA to adjust their tax returns to reflect the disability  amount for themselves or their dependant under 18 years of age, if eligibility  is approved. After the application is approved, CRA will automatically adjust  their tax returns for all applicable years. The CRA will include the federal  and provincial disability amounts for all years that apply. On the other hand,  the individual must send an adjustment request if:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>they are claiming the disability amount for  a dependant 18 or older</li>
    <li>they are claiming the disability amount for  their spouse or common law partner</li>
    <li>the disability amount needs to be divided  between two or more supporting persons</li>
  </ul>
  <li>As a volunteer, you can explain to individuals that Part A of the form is  straightforward to complete. They should have it filled in before meeting with  their qualified medical practitioner, while Part B is to be completed by their  qualified medical practitioner.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not a volunteer&rsquo;s  responsibility to complete the form T2201. For assistance, individuals can  contact the individual income tax enquiries line at 1-800-959-8281. </p>

  <li>An eligible  individual can accumulate $250 each year toward their Canada training credit  limit (CTCL), up to a maximum of $5,000 in a lifetime. The CTCL can be found on  their notice of assessment from the prior year. It can also be found through  AutoFill my Return.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>An individual  can claim the CTC for eligible tuition and other fees paid for courses taken in  the year if they meet <strong>all </strong>of these conditions:

  <ul>
    <li>the        individual was a resident in Canada throughout the year</li>
    <li>the        individual was at least 26 years old and less than 66 years old at the        end of the year</li>

<h3>Climate action incentive payment (CAIP)(45110)(schedule 14)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For residents of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Alberta only</li>
  <li>Prior to  2021, the climate action incentive was a refundable tax credit claimed annually  on the tax return, on line 45110 Climate action incentive. It required a  completed Schedule 14 to be submitted with the return.</li>
  <li>As of 2021, this  credit is now known as the climate action incentive payment (CAIP). The CAIP  will be paid as a quarterly benefit. If the individual is entitled to this  benefit, they will automatically receive it four times a year, starting in July  2022. Individuals do not need to apply for the CAIP as the CRA will determine  their eligibility when they file their taxes.</li>
  <li>As of the  2021 tax year, the credit will be paid to the spouse or common-law partner  whose tax return is assessed first. Although individuals can choose not to  claim the credit to make sure the spouse or common-law partner receives the  credit, we strongly recommend to allow the software to claim the credit for  everyone. This would make it likely that if an individual&rsquo;s marital status  changes, they would receive any CAIP they are entitled to. </li>
  <li>For the  purpose of the CAIP supplement for residents of small and rural communities,  individuals must have lived outside of a census metropolitan area (CMA) on  December 31 of the tax year. The software will automatically check <strong>Box 60104</strong> on Schedule 14 and submit it  with the return.</li>
