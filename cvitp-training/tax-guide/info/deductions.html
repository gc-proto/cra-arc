  </ul>
  <li>The individual may contribute to their RRSP up until  December 31 of the year they turn 71 years of age. The individual may still  carry unused RRSP contribution amounts forward, up to their deduction limit, to  be deducted in future years.The individual must confirm the  amount of their contributions, if any, they wish to deduct on their tax return,  leaving any leftover amount to be carried forward.

  <li>The individual may have amounts they have carried forward from previous  years, which must be entered in the software.

  <li>The northern residents is calculated on form T2222 and claimed on line 25500.</li>
  <li>The individual must have lived permanently, in a prescribed zone (Zone A or  Zone B), for at least six&nbsp;consecutive months, beginning or ending in the  tax year for which you are preparing the tax return. When the individual meets  all these requirements, they are eligible to claim northern residents  deductions.</li>
  <li>If the individual has not yet lived in a prescribed zone for at least  six&nbsp;consecutive months at the time of completing their tax return, they do  not yet qualify. You  may still complete the individual&rsquo;s tax return without making the claim and they  may make a request for the CRA to adjust their tax return once they become  eligible.</li>
  <li>To determine whether the individual&rsquo;s residence is in Zone A or Zone B, go  to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-25500-northern-residents-deductions.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_taxes-northern-residents" target="_blank">Line 25500 - Northern residents deductions</a> and click <strong>Places located in prescribed zones</strong>.</li>

      <li>the  residency deduction</li>
      <li>the  travel deduction</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The<strong> residency deduction</strong> is for having lived in a prescribed zone  and is made up of two parts:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>the basic residency amount</strong> can be claimed for the number of days in the year that the  individual lived in a prescribed zone </li>
      <li><strong>the additional residency amount </strong>can be claimed for the same number of days  that were used to calculate the individual&rsquo;s basic residency amount if they  are the <strong>only</strong> person claiming the  basic residency amount for the dwelling that they lived in during that period.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>travel deduction</strong> is for  costs related to travel that started from a prescribed zone and is made up of  two parts:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>medical travel</strong> (unlimited trips in the year) </li>
      <li><strong>other travel</strong> (limited to two trips per year, per person) </li>
      </ul>

  <p>Individuals may claim a deduction for travel  benefits even if they are <strong>not</strong><strong> </strong>claiming  a residency deduction.

  <li>For each trip, the software automatically claims the <strong>lowest of the  following three amounts</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>the  value of the taxable travel benefit received from employment (if any) or, under  proposed changes, the portion of the individual or an eligible family member&rsquo;s  $1,200 standard amount that is allocated to the trip</li>
    <li>the  total travel expenses paid for the trip using either the detailed or simplified  calculation methods </li>
    <li>the  lowest cost quoted for a flight from the airport closest to the individual&rsquo;s  residence to the nearest designated city (even if they did not actually travel  by air or to that city)<br>
      <br>
      Note: It is the individual&rsquo;s responsibility to  get the quote for the lowest return air fare. </li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>An individual cannot claim a travel deduction if <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:
    <ul>
      <li>they or their eligible family member  received or was entitled to receive non-taxable amounts as travel assistance,  travel allowance, or reimbursement for travel expenses</li>
      <li>someone else has already claimed the  deduction for travel benefits for this trip on their return</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the individual is claiming a deduction for medical travel on form T2222,  no one can claim it as a medical expense on their return.</li>
