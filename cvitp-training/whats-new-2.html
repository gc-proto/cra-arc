        <p>Through the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP), community organizations host free tax clinics where volunteers file tax returns for eligible people.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s new for free tax clinics:</p>
<h2>Virtual clinics</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce that we will continue to support virtual clinics for the 2022 filing season.</p>
<p>Virtual clinics provide an option, which follows physical distancing guidelines, for volunteers who want to continue serving their community by helping others complete their tax returns. Additionally, your organization can choose to host a virtual Northern communities clinic that serves individuals residing in northern communities (prescribed zones) within Canada. Any approved <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> organization across Canada, willing to offer tax filing services to northern communities, can now communicate this information in their clinic posting(s) on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program.html" target="_blank">Canada.ca</a></p>
<p>For more information on virtual clinics, please refer to the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers.html#grv" target="_blank">Important note: <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> Virtual clinics – Guidelines and resources for volunteers</a> .</p>

        <p>EFILE is an automated service that allows approved tax-preparers to send individual income tax return information to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> , directly from the EFILE certified tax-preparation software. Here’s what’s new for EFILE:</p>
<h2>Tax years accepted by EFILE</h2>
<p>EFILE will accept electronic filing for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 tax returns.</p>
<h2>Important dates for the filing season starting in February 2022</h2>

        <h3>Reminders</h3>
<p>You must only apply for an EFILE number <strong>if you intend to file returns electronically</strong>.</p>
<p>Volunteers must provide their organization with a valid police records check that has been issued within the last three years if they&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>plan to paper file</li>
<li>will be handling personal tax information</li>

        <p>Auto-fill my return (AFR) is a secure <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> service that can be used to automatically fill in parts of an individual’s federal Income Tax and Benefit Return with information that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;has available <strong>at the time of filing</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/autofill.html" target="_blank">Auto-fill my return</a> section of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> site has undergone a transformation this year so be sure to check it out to keep up to date with all the latest improvements.</p>
<p><abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers will continue to have the ability to use the Auto-fill my return service when completing tax returns for 2017 and subsequent years.</p>
<h2>Reminder</h2>
<p>To use <abbr title="Auto-fill my return">AFR</abbr> , you will need a valid police records check. For the purposes of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> , a police records check is considered valid if it was issued within the past three years. If your police records check was issued more than three years ago, you will require a new one.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you are currently using Windows 11, and you are experiencing problems with Auto-fill my return:</p>
<p>Older versions of UFile relied on Internet Explorer to access <abbr title="Auto-fill my return">AFR</abbr> . However, with the recent release of Windows 11, Microsoft Edge has replaced Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can install the latest update to UFile which has added support for the Microsoft Edge browser. Download the latest update from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ufile.ca/products/cvitp" target="_blank">UFILE</a> <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> by clicking on the tax year. Select the downloaded file, click to install and follow the instructions.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no need to uninstall UFile before downloading the file.</li>
<li>The Get Latest Updates or Automatic Updates will not provide the update, you must download it from the website.</li>
<li>This issue mostly impacts users running Windows 11. However, prior versions of Windows (10, 8, 7) may also be affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2021 version is currently undergoing the certification process and should be available to the public on February 17.</p>
<h2>Multi-factor authentication</h2>
<p>Last year, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> introduced new multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of its sign-in services and the protection of taxpayer information. Please be advised that enrollment in <abbr title="Multi-Factor Authentication">MFA</abbr> is now mandatory for all taxpayers using <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s sign-in services. This includes <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers using the Auto-fill my return or Represent a client services.</p>
<p>Cancelling mandatory enrollment status is no longer permitted under any circumstances. If you want the ability to access any <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> online services, you will need to enroll in <abbr title="Multi-Factor Authentication">MFA</abbr> .</p>

        <p>In this section we have outlined some of the changes made to the 2021 Income Tax and Benefit Guide and tax package:</p>
<h2>Tax package changes</h2>
<p>Several changes have been made to the <strong>2021 tax package</strong>, such as making the guide easier to read and moving the text for some income, deductions, and credits to the Federal Worksheet and schedules. You can also find more information about the lines on the return by going to canada.ca/line-xxxxx and replacing &quot;xxxxx&quot; with any five-digit line number from the return.</p>
<p>For example, go to canada.ca/line-10100 for information about line 10100. If you need information that is not provided in this tax package, call 1-800-959-8281.</p>
<h3>Reminder</h3>
<p>Direct deposit enrollment forms are no longer included in the tax packages. However, the option is still available for returns that are filed electronically through EFILE.</p>
<p>For more information on direct deposit, go to <a href="https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/txt/depot-deposit-eng.html" target="_blank">canada.ca/direct-deposit</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<h3>Notice of assessment</h3>
<p>Sometime in 2022, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;will begin the process of switching to electronic notices of assessment or reassessment. Taxpayers served under the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program/Income Tax Assistance -Volunteer Program will however, continue to have the option to receive a paper notice of assessment/reassessment. Please note that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;encourages the use of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html" target="_blank">My Account</a> and the retrieval of notices electronically where feasible.</p>
<h2>Income</h2>
<p>Here are the changes to income reported on a tax return for 2021:</p>
<h3>Amounts received related to COVID-19</h3>
<p>As a result of COVID-19, many individuals who were directly affected, received emergency benefits that provided them with financial support during the pandemic.</p>
<p>These payments are considered <strong>taxable income</strong>. The total amount received must be reported on the individual’s tax return.</p>
<p>For such payments, they will receive a T4A (for benefits issued by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>) or a T4E (for benefits issued by Service Canada).</p>
<p>If the individual received federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19 benefit payments, such as the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB), or Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), they will receive a T4A slip with instructions on how to report these amounts on their return. These slips are also available in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/my-cra-account" target="_blank">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>If the individual received the <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefit">CRB</abbr>, they may have to repay all or part of the amount received if their net income after certain adjustments is more than $38,000. The repayment is calculated using the chart for line 23500 of the Federal Worksheet.</p>
<p>If the individual’s income related to COVID-19 was tax exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act, they will need to complete Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax under the Indian Act, as well as their 2021 Income Tax and Benefit Return or simplified return to claim the tax withheld on their payments. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/indigenous-peoples.html" target="_blank">Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on COVID 19 and screen-by-screen instructions, visit the frequent client scenario <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/scenarios/covid-19.html" target="_blank">CRA and COVID-19</a>, found on the volunteer training page.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>For Indigenous peoples, COVID-19 benefits are taxable to the same extent as the income that made the recipient eligible to receive the benefit. For more information on the tax treatment and how to report the COVID-19 benefits for a Status Indian, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/scenarios/covid-19.html" target="_blank">CRA and COVID-19</a>.</p>
<h3>One-time payment for older seniors</h3>
<p>This one-time payment provided financial support through a taxable payment of $500 to older seniors in August 2021. They received the one-time payment if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>were born on or before June 30, 1947, and</li>
<li>were eligible for the Old Age Security pension in June 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>Eligible individuals who have already applied for the Old Age Security, would have automatically received the one-time payment for older seniors as early as the week of August 16, 2021.</p>

    <h3>Important note</h3>
    <p>Applications for the Old Age Security pension can be approved retroactively to June 2021 (or earlier) and this one-time payment will be received when Old Age Security pension payments begin. However, individuals must apply for the Old Age Security pension <strong>before</strong> May 31, 2022, or they will not be eligible for this one-time payment.</p>

<p><strong>Line 13010 – Taxable scholarships, fellowships, bursaries, and artists’ project grants</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in 2021, postdoctoral fellowship income would be included as earned income for registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) purposes. This change would provide postdoctoral fellows with additional <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> contribution room in order to make deductible <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr>, pooled registered pension plan (PRPP), or specified pension plan (SPP) contributions. This measure would apply retroactively to 2011. An individual can request an adjustment request to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to have their <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> contribution room adjusted.</p>
<p>Students who receive scholarships and bursaries (as well as fellowships, study grants, and artists’ project grants and awards) will have these amounts reported on a T4A slip. Generally, the income they received will be reported in box 105.</p>
<p>For information on how to enter scholarships and bursaries in UFile, visit our <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/scenarios/student.html#sab" target="_blank">screen-by-screen instructions</a>; from the Students topic.</p>
<h2>Deductions</h2>
<p>Here are the changes related to deductions claimed on a tax return for 2021:</p>
<p><strong>Line 21400 – Child care expenses</strong></p>
<p>Child care expenses are deductible if the child was under 16 years of age or had an impairment in physical or mental functions at some time in 2021, and if the use of child-care services allowed the individual looking after an eligible child to:</p>
<ul>
<li>earn income from employment;</li>
<li>carry on a business either alone or as an active&nbsp;partner;</li>
<li>attend school under the conditions identified under&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-21400-child-care-expenses/line-21400-who-claim-child-care-expenses/line-21400-educational-program.html" target="_blank">Educational&nbsp;program</a>;</li>
<li>carry on research or similar work, for which you or the other person received a&nbsp;grant.</li>
</ul>
<p>For 2020 and 2021, the requirements above do not have to be met if the individual was entitled to receive, in the year, any federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19 payments for which they have received a T4A or T4E slip, employment insurance benefits, employment insurance special benefits, or Quebec parental insurance plan benefits. The child must have lived with them or the other person when the expense was incurred for the expense to qualify.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-21400-child-care-expenses/line-21400-what-child-care-expenses.html" target="_blank">What are child care expenses?</a></p>
<p><strong>Line 23210 - Federal COVID-19 benefits repayment</strong></p>
<p>If the individual repaid federal COVID-19 benefits (<abbr title="Canada Emergency Response Benefit">CERB</abbr>, <abbr title="Canada Recovery Benefit">CRB</abbr>, <abbr title="Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit">CRCB</abbr>, <abbr title="Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit">CRSB</abbr> or <abbr title="Canada Emergency Student Benefit">CESB</abbr>) in 2021 that they received in 2020, they can claim a deduction for the repayment.</p>
<p>If they received their <abbr title="Canada Emergency Response Benefit">CERB</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li>from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, the amount repaid will be reported in box 201 of their T4A slip</li>
<li>from Service Canada, the amount repaid will be reported in box 30 of their T4E slip, along with other <abbr title="Employment Income">EI</abbr> amounts repaid. Service Canada will also send them a letter showing the exact portion of the amount in box 30 that is <abbr title="Canada Emergency Response Benefit">CERB</abbr> repayment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The individual can claim a deduction for the federal COVID-19 benefits repayment in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>on line 23210 of their 2021 return</li>
<li>on line 23200 of their 2020 return</li>
<li>on both their 2020 and 2021 returns as long as the total amount claimed is not more than the combined amounts reported in box 201 of their T4A slip and the letter from Service Canada</li>

        <h3>Northern residents deductions</h3>
<p>The deduction for travel benefits has expanded to include eligible northern residents who take a trip even if their employer does not provide travel benefits for personal travel.</p>
<p>Individuals can take up to two trips for non-medical reasons and any number of trips for medical purposes. The individual can calculate the travel deduction for each trip by either using a portion of a $1,200 standard amount per person or the value of the taxable travel benefit received from employment.</p>

<h3>Home office expenses for employees</h3>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><h3>Important note</h3>
<p>As an exception to the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> eligibility guidelines, volunteers can complete tax returns where an employed individual is claiming the deduction for home office expenses<strong> for employees</strong>, <strong>only if</strong> the individual is choosing to use the new <strong>temporary flat rate</strong> <strong>method</strong> to claim their deduction. Using the detailed method is <strong>not</strong> considered a simple tax situation. The <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> does <strong>not</strong> provide training for or support complex tax situations, which includes the use of the detailed method.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information on simple tax situations, see the <strong>Eligibility criteria,</strong> on the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/about.html" target="_blank">About free tax clinics</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>The government has extended the Home office expenses for employees for the 2021 and 2022 tax years. Employees working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic may be able to claim up to $500 using the temporary flat rate method.</p>
<p>Please note for the 2020 tax year, the maximum amount allowed to claim still remains at $400.</p>

        <h2>Refundable tax credits</h2>
<p>Here are the changes related to refundable tax credits claimed on a tax return for 2021:</p>
<h3>Canada workers benefit</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;Canada workers benefit (CWB)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a refundable tax credit intended to provide tax relief for eligible low-income individuals and families in the workforce. For the 2021 and subsequent taxation years, a new “secondary earner exemption” has been introduced. This would allow the spouse or common-law partner with the lower working income to reduce their adjusted net income up to $14,000.</p>
<p>For example, without the secondary earner exemption, a dual-earner couple with adjusted family net income of $50,000 would receive no <abbr title="Canada workers benefit">CWB</abbr>&nbsp;in 2021. With the introduction of the secondary earner exemption, the secondary earner's adjusted net income would be reduced by the lesser of their working income ($20,000) and $14,000. The adjusted family net income would then be $36,000 which would entitle the couple to the benefit.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s6.html" target="_blank">Schedule 6 - Canada Workers Benefit</a>.</p>
<h3>Climate action incentive</h3>
<p>The Climate action incentive credit will now be delivered as quarterly payments. Individuals who are eligible, will automatically receive their <abbr title="Climate Action Incentive">CAI</abbr> payments four times a year, starting in July 2022. Individuals must file a tax return, even if they did not receive any income for the year, in order to be eligible.</p>
