  <h2 id="h1">Overview</h2>

  <p>EFILE is an automated service that allows CVITP volunteers  and other approved tax preparation service providers to electronically send  individual income tax return information to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p>
  <p> The EFILE web service is available to transmit returns from  the 2017 tax year to present. <strong></strong></p>
  <p>    EFILE transmission services are open for the majority of the  year, typically starting in February. Exact dates for the current year can be  found in What&rsquo;s  new  for this filing season.<strong></strong></p>
  <h2 id="h2">Registering to use EFILE</h2>
  <p>You must only apply for an EFILE number&nbsp;if you intend  to file returns electronically. Your EFILE number must be renewed annually.</p>
  <p> Volunteers who are approved to file electronically are not  required to provide a police records check,&nbsp;unless they are using the  Auto-fill my return service.</p>
  <p> For more information, refer to Register to volunteer.&nbsp;</p>
<section class="alert alert-info">	
  <p>Although  you will be issued an EFILE number and password as soon as you apply, your  application may take up to 30 business days to process. To give us enough time  to review your application before the filing season starts, we encourage you to  file your application before December 31.</p>
</section>	
  <h2 id="h3">Getting ready to use EFILE</h2>
  <p>If you are working on a computer that is also used by other  volunteers, you must open the&nbsp;EFILE-NetFile setup&nbsp;and ensure  that&nbsp;your&nbsp;EFILE number, password and&nbsp;COIN&nbsp;(if available)  are entered correctly&nbsp;before you complete any tax returns, every time you use  the computer.</p>
  <p>To set up EFILE, refer to the instructions in EFILE-NetFile  setup.</p>
  <h2 id="h4">EFILING the tax return</h2>
  <p>There are a number of steps that the software will take you  through in order to successfully transmit a tax return using&nbsp;EFILE. For  screen-by-screen instructions, refer to EFILING the return. </p>
  <p> In order to complete prior year returns with  UFile&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;software, you must install the applicable version for each  year you wish to prepare. If you are preparing prior year tax returns,  select&nbsp;<strong>Yes</strong>&nbsp;in response to the question&nbsp;<strong>Will you be  using EFILE to submit a prior year federal return, today or within the next two  days?</strong></p>
<div class="well brdr-rds-0">
<p class="h4 mrgn-tp-0"><i class="far fa-lightbulb fa-lgmrgn-rght-sm"></i> Tip</p>  
<p>You  cannot transmit returns electronically prior to 2017. However, you can still  complete and print the returns using UFile&nbsp;CVITP. You can prepare tax  returns as far back as ten calendar years. For information on how to print  returns, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/tax-preparation-software-overview.html#prn" target="_blank">Providing the tax  return and forms</a>.</p>
</div>	
  <p> When you prepare previous year returns, it is recommended  that you begin with the earliest year and continue in order.</p>
  <p> Once you complete all steps to EFILE  the tax return and have clicked&nbsp;<strong>File my return now!</strong>, UFile connects  directly to the&nbsp;CRA&nbsp;to transmit the tax return. It may take a few  minutes to transmit the return as the system conducts an initial review on each  tax return transmitted.</p>
  <p>    For screen-by-screen  instructions on Accepted or Rejected EFILE transmissions, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/tax-preparation-software-overview.html#etr" target="_blank">EFILING the tax return</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="h5">Verifying EFILE transmission errors</h2>
  <p>The system can reject an EFILE transmission multiple times  with different error codes.</p>
  <p> If you receive error messages when you transmit the tax  return, refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4018.html" target="_blank">RC4018, Electronic Filers Manual</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Chapter 2</strong>.</p>
  <p> The manual explains how the error codes are set, what they  mean, and how to respond to them.</p>
  <p> Correct the information as instructed in the manual&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;you  attempt to transmit the return again.</p>
  <p> If you cannot find an error code in the RC4018, or you need  additional help to resolve an error code, contact your regional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers/efile-helpdesk-support-t1-returns.html" target="_blank">EFILE Helpdesk support</a>. This information can also be  found under&nbsp;useful  links.</p>
  <p>When you attempt to re-transmit a return after you correct  an error, it is important to ensure that you have received either a green&nbsp;<strong>Accepted&nbsp;</strong>status,  or a red&nbsp;<strong>Rejected&nbsp;</strong>status in the&nbsp;<strong>Federal EFILE  Report&nbsp;</strong>generated by UFile&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;before you move on to a new  individual's tax return.</p>
  <p> If the&nbsp;<strong>Federal EFILE Report&nbsp;</strong>status for the  re-transmission is:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Accepted       -&nbsp;</strong>proceed to the steps found under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/complete-return.html#apr">After preparing the income tax return</a></li>
    <li><strong>Rejected&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;print&nbsp;a       paper copy of the return for the taxpayer and instruct them to mail it to       the&nbsp;CRA&nbsp;for processing </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To ensure you provide the individual with the correct mailing address for their applicable Tax Centre, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">Find a CRA address - Canada.ca</a>.</p>
