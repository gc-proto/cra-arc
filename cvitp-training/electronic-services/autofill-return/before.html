<h2 id="h1">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is optional to use  Auto-fill my return. You can still file returns electronically without using  this service. However, the CRA encourages the use of AFR as it helps reduce  errors and increase the number of accurate returns.</p>
<p> Using AFR can also  improve the service you offer to individuals with missing income slips and to  those who may be faced with language barriers or other factors preventing them  from getting access to their information. </p>
<p> The following  information is available through AFR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tax information slips</li>
  <li>RRSP contribution limit</li>
  <li>Home Buyers&rsquo; Plan repayment amount</li>
  <li>tuition, education, and textbook carry forward  amounts (federal and provincial)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete list,  refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/about-auto-fill-return.html" target="_blank">Auto-fill my return</a> on canada.ca.</p>
<p> CVITP volunteers do  not have access to the Client Data Enquiry page through the Auto-fill my return  service.</p>
<p>  To use AFR, you must  file an Authorization request in the <strong>current year</strong> UFile CVITP software  for each individual served. Refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/autofill/howto.html#sar" target="_blank">screen by  screen instructions - Submitting Authorization request</a>.</p>
<p> AFR can only  download information that the CRA has available at the time of filing. When you  prepare returns for individuals, you still need to enter other income slips  that have not yet been received by the CRA and additional tax information, such  as medical expenses and child care.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Authorization terms  and conditions for CVITP</h2>
<details>
<summary>Disclaimer</summary>
<p>  To use AFR, you must  agree to the Authorization Terms and Conditions for CVITP. If you disagree, you  cannot use the AFR service.</p>
</details>
<p>  To maintain the  confidentiality of taxpayer information as required by section 241 of the  Income Tax Act, I agree to the three following conditions. I also acknowledge  that if I do not meet these conditions, my privileges to electronically submit  an authorization request could be suspended. I hereby agree that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the electronic  submission capabilities of this software package will only be used for  activities related to preparing and completing tax return(s) for the taxpayer  identified on the Authorization request - signature page </li>
  <li>I will submit the  information on behalf of the taxpayer on the date the signature page was signed </li>
  <li>I will provide each  taxpayer with the Authorization request - signature page in its original or  other acceptable formats </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h3">Requirements for  using AFR </h2>
<p>To use AFR, you <strong>must</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>register in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html" target="_blank">Represent a Client</a> and obtain a RepID </li>
  <li>register as a CVITP volunteer</li>
  <li>provide your RepID during registration; or, if  registration is already completed, provide it directly to your CRA coordinator</li>
  <li>apply for an EFILE number or renew your EFILE  account</li>
  <li>provide a valid police records check (PRC) to your  organization</li>
  <li>use the UFile CVITP software</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information  on registrations, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/volunteer.html" target="_blank">Register to volunteer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h4">Police records check (PRC) </h2>
<p>With increased  access to individuals&rsquo; information comes a certain amount of risk. As a result  of this increased risk, and to protect individuals' personal information, all  volunteers who wish to use the Auto-fill my return service are asked to obtain a  valid police records check (PRC).</p>
<p> You are responsible to  obtain your PRC. A PRC can be issued through any police service, including  municipal and regional police forces, or through a private company that  provides personal background checks. Typically, there is a cost to obtain a  PRC. Your organization may be able to provide you with a letter that will allow  PRC fees to be waived or reduced.</p>
<p> Once you obtain a  PRC you must provide it to your community organization.</p>

<section class="alert alert-info">	
<h3>PRC Validity</h3>
<p>  For the CVITP, a PRC is considered valid if it was  issued within the past three years. If your PRC was issued more than three  years ago, you require a new one. PRC results should be consistent with the  program terms that you agreed to during registration.</p>

You are  responsible for filling in the expiry date. The expiry date and the date the  Authorization request is signed must always be the same. </p>
<p><strong>Filing the  Authorization request</strong></p>
<p>  Before you ask the  individual to sign the Authorization request – signature page, you must read  them a script that fully discloses what they are consenting to. You must read  the entire script as it is written.</p>

<details>	
<summary>View Script</summary>
<p> As an individual,  your CRA account information is private and confidential. As a CVITP volunteer, 
  I am part of a group  of CVITP volunteers that can act as an authorized representative on your  account.</p>
<p>Your consent is  required to authorize this group on your account so that I can use the 
  Auto-fill my return  service to complete your income tax return. This authorization will 
  also allow me to  view your tax information online, through the CRA&rsquo;s Represent a Client 
  service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your Social Insurance Number (SIN) is required  before any information can be viewed online.</li>
  <li>This authorization does not allow me to make any  changes to your personal/tax information online.</li>
  <li>This authorization is only valid until 11:59 p.m.  tonight (EST).</li>
</ul>
<p>I will send this  page electronically (via my computer) to the CRA and I will provide you 
  with a paper copy  for you to sign and keep for your records.</p>
<p>Do you authorize me,  as part of the CVITP group, to represent you in communications 
  with the CRA, and to  use the Auto-fill my return and/or Represent a client services on 
  your behalf? YES or  NO </p>
</details>	
<p>A child can sign the  Authorization request – signature page at age 16. </p>
<ul>
  <li>For CRA purposes, a child can act on their behalf  and appoint a representative of their choice at the age of 16, unless the child  is mentally disabled or not competent</li>
  <li>The parent or legal guardian of a minor would be  able to authorize a third party to act as an authorized representative for tax  matters of that child, but only until that child reaches the legal age of  consent (adulthood/age of majority) in their province. 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>18</strong> years old in  Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan</li>
    <li><strong>19</strong> years old in  British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest  Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, and Yukon </li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The signed  authorization must be given to the individual for their records.<br>
  Once the form is  accepted by the CRA, the CVITP GroupID is listed as the authorized  representative on the individual&rsquo;s account. This authorization allows the  volunteer, as a member of the Group, to use AFR on the individual&rsquo;s behalf and  to view their tax information online through the Represent a Client portal.</p>

<div class="well brdr-rds-0">
<p class="h4 mrgn-tp-0"><i class="far fa-lightbulb fa-lgmrgn-rght-sm"></i> Tip</p>	
<p> <strong>As of January 2021</strong>, when a volunteer, who is authorized on an  individual&rsquo;s account, calls the CRA on behalf of the taxpayer, they will be  asked for their RepID.</p>
<p> The call centre agent will confirm the CVITP  GroupID is authorized on the individual's account and verify that the  volunteer&rsquo;s RepID is associated with the CVITP GroupID.</p>
<p> Once the call centre agent confirms this  information, the volunteer will be granted access to the individual's  confidential information over the telephone.</p>
</div>
	
<h3>Filing the  Authorization request virtually</h3>
<p>  If you are using AFR virtually, you must obtain verbal authorization from  the individual to send the authorization form to the CRA. You must read the  following script exactly as it is written.</p>

<p>You must also complete  a TIS60  for each individual for whom you are completing a tax return, whether or not  you are using AFR. </p>
<p><strong>Multi-factor  authentication - Auto-fill my return (AFR) and CVITP volunteers</strong></p>
<p>  Last year, the  CRA&nbsp;introduced a new multi-factor authentication (MFA) security feature to  enhance the security of its&nbsp;sign-in services. This extra layer of security  has been put in place to ensure the safety and protection of taxpayer  information.</p>
<section class="alert alert-info">	
<p> Enrollment in MFA&nbsp;is now mandatory for all taxpayers  using&nbsp;CRA&rsquo;s sign-in services – including CVITP volunteers using the  Auto-fill my return or Represent a client services.</p>
</section>	
<p> It is no longer  permitted to cancel the mandatory enrollment status under any circumstances. If  you do not want to enroll in MFA, you will not be able to access any CRA online  services.</p>
<p>  For more information  on using the multi-factor authentication security feature for CRA sign-in  services, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/multi-factor-authentication-access-cra-login-services.html" target="_blank">Multi-factor authentication to  access&nbsp;CRA&nbsp;login services</a>.</p>
