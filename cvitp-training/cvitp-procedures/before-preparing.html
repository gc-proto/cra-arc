  <h2 id="h1">Screening for eligibility</h2>
  <p>Before you start  preparing a tax return, you must screen all individuals&rsquo; information to ensure  they meet the eligibility for the CVITP. Depending on your role or  organization, you may be responsible for completing the eligibility screening of  an individual&rsquo;s information. Refer to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/about.html" target="_blank">eligibility  criteria</a> under Introduction  to free tax clinics.</p>

  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">File my Return</h3>	

    <p>This CRA service  offers eligible individuals the ability to submit their tax return by answering  a series of short questions through an automated phone service. Only  individuals who receive an invitation letter from the CRA may participate.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If  during the screening process an individual confirms they received a <strong>File my  Return</strong> invitation letter, you should verify if they contacted the CRA. </li>
      <li>If the  individual contacted the CRA to use <strong>File my Return</strong>, their tax return has already been submitted, so no  further action is required. However, if the individual has not yet contacted  the CRA, you should ask if they wish to use the <strong>File my Return</strong> service  and may offer to assist with the call. If they opt out, you may instead offer  to complete their tax return in person or virtually by using the CVITP tax  preparation software.</li>
    </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>be valid</li>
    <li>be government issued</li>
    <li>include a photo</li>

  <p>Only  if you are participating in a free virtual clinic can you get an individual&rsquo;s verbal  consent instead of signing Section I of the TIS60. Additionally, for verbal  consent you must ensure the individual is aware of and agrees to the following  conditions: </p>
  <div>
    <div> </div>
  </div>
<ol>
  <li>You are a volunteer under the  CVITP and not acting as an agent of the Canada Revenue Agency 
<details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p> Hello,  my name is (insert name). I&rsquo;m a volunteer from the Community Volunteer Income  Tax Program. I will prepare your income tax and benefits return(s)  electronically for you with the information you supplied. </p>
  <p> I  am a volunteer with (organization name) here to provide this service to you. I  am not an employee of the Canada Revenue Agency. </p>
  <p> Do  I have your permission to complete and file your income tax return? </p>
	  </details>

    <li>The method(s) of communication may  potentially be unsecure 
<details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p>We will be discussing your  personal information so that I may prepare your tax return. I have and will  continue to take all reasonable efforts to ensure information is kept safe,  however, the method of communication we are using may not be secure. </p>
  <p>Regarding  use of cell phone, video or email:</p>
  <p> Do you consent to the use of a <strong>cell phone or cordless telephone</strong> to  discuss information needed to prepare your income tax and benefits return(s)? </p>
  <p>Do you consent to the use of <strong>videoconference</strong> (insert name of  application) to discuss information needed to prepare your income tax and  benefits return(s)?</p>

  <h2 id="h4">Gathering and verifying the individual&rsquo;s information </h2>
  <p>You may consider organizing  the slips and receipts as they apply to the different sections of the income tax  return to save time and reduce errors. For example, keeping all T4 slips  together makes them easier to find when entering employment income information into  the tax software.</p>
<p> The most common  information slips and receipts may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>T4, T5, T5007, T4AA and  T4(OAS)</li>
    <li>receipts for child care, medical expenses, and RRSP  contributions</li>
    <li>charitable donation receipts, including those made  in the current year and any donations made and not claimed within the last five  years</li>
    <li>tuition receipts, such as T2202, TL11A, or TL11B</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Confirm the accuracy of the information reported  on the slips (for example, name, SIN, and issuer) with the individual. If a  slip has inaccurate information, the individual must contact the issuer of the  slip to have it corrected. Individuals&nbsp;waiting for a slip issue to be  resolved are still encouraged to have their tax return prepared before the  deadline. This will ensure there are no interruptions to any benefit or credit  payments they may be entitled to, and help avoid late-filing penalties. </p>
  <p>If an individual is missing a slip, you can obtain their  information by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>using Auto-fill my return or sign into Represent a  client for the individual</li>
    <li>calling the dedicated help line for volunteers  at&nbsp;1-866-398-3488 </li>
    <li>asking the individual to contact their employer or  payer</li>
    <li>using pay stubs or statements to estimate the missing  income and deductions </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In  cases where you will not be preparing the spouse or common-law partner&rsquo;s tax  return, the individual will be required to provide the following information  about their spouse or common-law partner:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>first name</li>
    <li>SIN</li>
    <li>net income </li>
    <li>if applicable
    <ul>
      <li>confirmation that they were  self-employed during the year</li>
      <li>Universal Child Care Benefit  (UCCB) amount shown on line 11700 of their tax return</li>
      <li>UCCB reimbursement amount  indicated on line 21300 of their tax return</li>

    <li>Did you  earn any tips?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you need to call the dedicated help line for volunteers to obtain missing information,  you need to obtain the individual&rsquo;s authorization that allows  you to use the <strong>Auto-fill my return</strong> service to prepare their tax return and it must be within the same calendar day  as that authorization was made. If the individual has not authorized use of the <strong>Auto-file my return</strong> service then they need to be present while you make  the call because they will need to speak directly with the agent to answer some  confidentiality questions. Once confidentiality is met, the individual can  provide the agent with verbal authorization for you to speak on their behalf for  only the duration of that telephone call.</p>

    </ul>
