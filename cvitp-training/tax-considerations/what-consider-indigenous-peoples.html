      <h2 id="h1">Status Indian definition</h2>
      <p>Many First Nations people in  Canada prefer not to be referred to as <strong>Indians</strong>. However, for&nbsp;purposes of the tax  exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the CRA uses the term Indian  because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act. Individuals who are Indians,  as defined in the Indian Act, are often referred to as Status Indians.</p>
      <p> Generally, a Status Indian is subject to the same tax  rules as other Canadian residents&nbsp;unless their income is eligible for tax  exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act. If a Status Indian's personal  property, including income, is earned or situated on a reserve&nbsp; then it is exempt from tax. This may  include employment income earned by a Status Indian who does not live on a  reserve, but who performs their duties of employment on a reserve.</p>
      <p> For more information, refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/indigenous-peoples/indian-act-exemption-employment-income-guidelines.html" target="_blank">Indian  Act Exemption for Employment Income Guidelines</a>.</p>
 
	<section class="alert alert-warning">
         <p>As a&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;volunteer, you are not    required to determine an individual's status, nor are you required to    determine an individual's income exemption.</p>
</section>
      <h2 id="h2">Employment-related  income</h2>
      <p>Usually, if a Status Indian  receives the following types of income, the CRA will treat them in the same way  as the employment income that gave rise to the benefit:</p>
	
      <ul>
        <li>Employment Insurance benefits </li>
        <li>Canada Pension Plan benefits</li>
        <li>Quebec Pension Plan benefits </li>
        <li>registered pension plan benefits</li>
        <li>retiring allowances</li>
        <li>wage-loss replacement plan benefits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In other words, if the employment income is exempt from income tax under  section 87 of the Indian Act, the employment-related income will also be  exempt. If part of the employment income is exempt, any employment-related  income arising from that exempt income will also be exempt from income tax.</p>
      <h2 id="h3">Exempt  income</h2>
      <p>Certain amounts cannot be  claimed as deductions if they are directly related to tax-exempt income. If the  income is only partially exempt, the deduction will be granted in the same  proportion. For example, a Status Indian who pays union dues and&nbsp;whose  income is only 60% exempt, would only be able to claim 40% of the union dues as  a deduction to offset the taxable portion of employment income.</p>
      <p> Oher deductions might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Registered Pension Plan (RPP) contributions</li>
        <li>Employment expenses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tax-exempt income is not taken  into consideration in the calculation of many deductions, tax credits, and  benefits, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Canada child benefit (CCB)</li>
        <li>GST/HST credit</li>
        <li>RRSP deduction limits</li>
        <li>charitable donations</li>
        <li>medical expenses</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="h4">Form T90 Income exempt under the  Indian Act </h2>
      <p>Individuals who are registered  or entitled to be registered as an Indian under the Indian Act <strong>and</strong> have income that is tax exempt under the Indian Act can use the form T90 to  calculate their net exempt income so that the CRA&nbsp;can properly calculate  their&nbsp;Canada training credit limit (CTCL) for the following year, if  applicable, and the Canada workers benefit (CWB) for the current tax year.</p>
      <p> For example, if an individual&rsquo;s  tax exempt income qualifies them for the CWB, &nbsp;that same exempt income  would not affect the calculation of their Canada child benefit (CCB) or  their&nbsp;GST/HST&nbsp;credit. </p>
      <h2 id="h5">Tax slips that do not indicate  exemptions </h2>
      <p>These slips do not indicate if  the stated income is fully or partially exempt from tax, or if it needs to be  included or excluded from an individual&rsquo;s return. It is the individual&rsquo;s  responsibility to inform you of any tax exempt amounts.</p>
