<h2 id="h_1">Our review of your application</h2>
<p>Once we receive your application, we will assess it to determine if you are eligible for the Disability Tax Credit  (DTC) based on the information given by the medical practitioner. If we need more information, we may contact you or the medical practitioner.</p>

	

<p>If you sent your Form T2201 with your tax return, the CRA will review your application <strong>before</strong> assessing your tax return.</p>
<h3><span class="far fa-clock"></span> How long it will take</h3>
	<p>With the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">Check CRA Processing Times</a> tool, you can quickly find out when you can expect us to complete your request or get back to you. To use the tool, select the relevant information from the drop-down menus and the tool will display a target date for your request to be done or the length of time we expect it will take based on our service standards.</p>
	
	<p><mark>Can we just ajax in the answer from the tool so the user doesn't have to leave the site?</mark></p>
	<p>Our service standard is to issue a Notice of Determination advising whether the eligibility has been allowed or disallowed <strong>within 8 weeks of receiving your Disability Tax Credit Certificate</strong>.</p>

<p>Some applications are considered complex and will take longer to process. Complex requests include situations where additional information or clarification from the medical practitioner, or, supporting documentation from the taxpayer is required.</p>

<p>The CRA aims to meet this standard 95% of the time.</p>
<h2 id="h_2">Replying to our clarification letter</h2>
<p>If we ask you to send supporting documents or receipts, you may do so by using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. You will receive a letter containing a reference number and instructions on how to proceed.</p>

        <h3 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h5">Approved<span class="wb-inv">: Option 1 of 2</span></h3>

        <p>The notice of determination will show which year(s) you are eligible for the DTC. You won't need to submit a new Form T2201 every year, unless we tell you that we need one. Information about <a href="related.html">other programs that are dependent on eligibility for the DTC</a> may also be included in the notice of determination.</p>
<p>When your eligibility is about to expire, we will notify you one year in advance as well as in the year it expires.</p>
<p>You can view your DTC information in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>You should tell us if your medical condition improves to the point that you no longer meet the criteria for the DTC.</p></dd>

        <h3 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Denied<span class="wb-inv">: Option 2 of 2</span></h3>

       <p>If you received a notice of determination stating that your DTC application was denied, the notice of determination will explain why. Check your copy of Form T2201 against the reason given. We base our decision on the information given by the medical practitioner.</p>
