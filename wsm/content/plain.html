	<h2 id="h-1">Benefits of plain language</h2>
	
      <p>Writing in plain language doesn't mean over-simplifying or leaving out critical information.</p>
      <p>By writing plainly and simply, you: </p>
      <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> increase the chances that people will find, read and understand your information from any device</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> make your information more accessible to people with disabilities</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> allow people who are reading your information on a small screen to see essential information first</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> save resources when editing and translating your text</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> improve task completion and cuts costs by, for example, reducing enquiries</li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-2">Avoid jargon, idioms, and expressions </h2>
      <p>Where possible, avoid using jargon, idioms, and expressions. Use the clearest, most popular term for your audience.</p>
      <p>Legal and technical terms and "government-speak" confuse most people.</p>
      <p>People who don't speak English or French might use online tools to translate text. These tools don't always translate idioms and expressions accurately. </p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg">
        <li>Bench warrant = <strong>Jargon</strong><br>
          <span class="text-muted">(an order by a judge to arrest someone who didn't show up in court or comply with certain conditions)</span></li>
        <li>To hire a helping hand = <strong>Idiom</strong><br>
          <span class="text-muted">(meaning to hire an employee)</span></li>
        <li>Attack your least favourite task first = <strong>Expression</strong><br>
          <span class="text-muted">(meaning do your least favourite task first)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">If you must include jargon familiar to your target audience, be sure to: </p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> explain it using simple, familiar words or give an example to help non-specialists understand</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> never use jargon to explain jargon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> You have to file your income tax return (T1) by April 30.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> You have to file your T1 return by April 30.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Learn about savings plans that can help you save enough money to retire.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Learn about different types of savings plans that will let you build up your retirement nest egg.</li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-3">Abbreviations and acronyms</h2>
	 <p>Don't use an abbreviation or acronym unless it's better known to the widest audience than its long-form equivalent. For example: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>EI</li>
        <li>RCMP</li>
        <li>T4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have to use a multi-word term more than once on a web page, use the full term the first time you use it. For any further uses of the term:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use a short form such as "the program" or "the plan," in lower case instead of repeating the full term or using an abbreviation</li>
        <li>only use an abbreviation for a secondary reference if analytics data or usability testing determines that people often use and search for the abbreviation </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always spell out an abbreviation the first time you use it on a page.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> There are 15 client contact centres across Canada.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> There are 15 CCCs across Canada.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> The&nbsp;act&nbsp;strengthens the Government of Canada's commitment to…</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The&nbsp;EEA&nbsp;strengthens the Government of Canada's commitment to… </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Include abbreviations that your audience uses in your metadata (for example, in the description field) to help search engines find your page more easily.</p>
      <section class="alert alert-info">
        <h3> Tip: avoid abbreviations and acronyms by rethinking the content </h3>
        <p>If your content contains a lot of abbreviations and acronyms, rethink its structure. Consider placing related content under distinct headings and sections.</p>
        <p>For example, when introducing legal requirements, use the title of the act once, if necessary, and then talk about what people "must" do. The context will make it clear that the things they "must" do are requirements under the act. Don't use the abbreviation for the act, because it makes the text harder to follow. </p>
        <p>Close the topic before referring to other obligations under different legislation.</p>
      </section>
      <h3>Latin abbreviations</h3>
      <p>Avoid using e.g. and i.e. Use clearer alternatives instead, for example:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> for example, such as, or like</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> e.g.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> that is, in other words</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> i.e.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may use these abbreviations when space is limited, for example, in a table or a figure.</p>
      <h3>Use words in transition consistently</h3>
      <p>Words and expressions in transition are those written commonly in 2 or more different ways. Reduce confusion by using the following spellings: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>website (not "web site")</li>
        <li>web page (not "webpage")</li>
        <li>web (not "Web")</li>
        <li>email (not "e-mail")</li>
        <li>online (not "on line")</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Use of ampersand</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Spell out the word "and" instead of using an ampersand (&amp;)</li>
        <li>Use the ampersand only for proper names when it's part of a company name and in certain abbreviations, including:
          <ul>
            <li>R&amp;D (research and development)</li>
            <li>O&amp;M (operating and maintenance)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
	  <h2 id="h-4">Use simple and common words</h2>
      <p>Replace long words with short, simple and everyday words that most people understand and use. Simple words have 2 syllables or less. They're easier to scan than long, complex words. </p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> ask</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> make a request</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> you must</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> you shall</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> to</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> in order to</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> before</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> prior to</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> get</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> obtain</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
	<h2 id="h-5">Use simple sentences</h2>
	<p>Keep sentence structure simple by putting the subject and the verb at the beginning of the sentence and by using the subject + verb + object construction. This structure helps the reader understand what the subject of the sentence is doing by placing the subject first, followed by the verb.</p>
      <p>Avoid complex and compound sentences. They generally contain too much information for people to understand when they're scanning.</p>
      <p>Example (replace complex sentence structures with direct statements):</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Learn about Canada's transportation system. Find information about using paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports across the country. </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Canada's vast transportation system enables millions of people each year to travel throughout the country, around the world, and to work and back. From this page you can access a wealth of transportation information related to travelling and commuting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example (replace noun strings (a series of 2 or more nouns used to name something) with direct statements)</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> You have until April 30 to file your tax return.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The period of time that you have to file your tax return ends on April 30.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example (surround a long sentence with shorter ones because it helps people understand the long sentence)</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> The evaluation team will submit its final report on the training program in September.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The training program evaluation team will submit its final report in September.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <mark>(Note to rewrite)...the above "subject+verb" model isn't want the guide uses...instead it does this: Write direct statements, and start with the verb when you describe  actions. Eliminate any descriptive information that precedes the verb.</mark>
      </p>
	  
    
	<h2 id="h-6">Use short sentences and paragraphs</h2>
	<p>Be concise. Use as few words as possible to express an idea. By being concise, you'll help everyone, even specialists, complete the task they set out to do.</p>
      <p>Keep sentences and paragraphs short to make them easier to scan on any screen size. People who have learning disabilities may find it difficult to scan and understand long sentences and paragraphs. </p>
      <p>Try to keep sentences under 20 words. You can do this by:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> breaking long sentences into shorter ones</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> limiting each sentence to 1 idea </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> removing unnecessary words</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> We received your request for funding and approved it.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> We received your request for funding, which we've thoroughly reviewed and approved in a timely manner.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> We'll consider any type of investment.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Any type of investment will be taken into consideration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">Try to keep paragraphs to 3 sentences. You can do this by:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> developing 1 main idea per paragraph </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> presenting a series of more than 2 ideas or words as a vertical list</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> using a short form for a long title instead of repeating it</li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-7">Active versus passive voice</h2>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-bttm">
        <dt>Active voice</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>In an active sentence, the subject does the action. The sentence is clear and direct.</p>
          <p> <strong>Example:</strong> We may ask you to provide proof of citizenship.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Passive voice</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>In a passive sentence, it may not be clear who or what is doing the action.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> You may be asked to provide proof of citizenship.</p>
          <p>Passive voice creates confusion for readers; it is not clear who is responsible for the action.  Passive  voice results from the use of the verb "to be". To write in an active, positive voice, avoid the following 8 words:</p>
          <ul class="list-inline mrgn-bttm-md">
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> is</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> was </li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> were</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> are</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> am</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> been</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> being</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> be </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Exception:</strong> When "is" &nbsp;describes a state of  being, it is not in a passive voice, and is freely used. For example: "Government is responsible for respecting Official Languages."</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>In an active    sentence, a person, thing, or an    entity does an action. In a passive sentence, the action is done to an object by a person,    thing or an entity.</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Passport Canada creates resources for travelers </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Resources for travelers were created by Passport Canada.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Awareness team conducts    training across the    department.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Training was conducted across the department.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Positive or negative form</h3>
      <p>Whenever possible, tell people what they may or must do instead of what they may not or must not do. Avoid negatives, double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.</p>
      <p>Example (positive/negative):</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong>You're entitled to part of the deduction.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> You're not entitled to the entire deduction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples (positive/double negative):</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> The procedure will be effective.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The procedure will not be ineffective.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> You may claim a child born in 1972 or earlier as a dependent, if he or she has a mental or physical disability.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> You may not claim anything for a dependent child born in 1972 or earlier, unless the child has a mental or physical disability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mrgn-tp-lg"><strong>Exception:</strong> If something has serious consequences, you can use the negative form to explain that something isn't possible or should not be done. </p>
      <ul class="fa-ul ">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;try to locate the source of carbon monoxide. Leave your home immediately and move to fresh air. </li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-8">Use verbs instead of nouns formed from verbs</h2>
	<p>Avoid using nouns that are formed from verbs. They can be vague. Verbs alone clearly express the action needed.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> apply</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> submit your application </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> consider</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> take into consideration </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> modify</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> make a modification </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> needs</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> is in need of </li>
      </ul>
	   <p>Always use the simplest form of a verb. When possible, use the present tense.</p>
	<h2 id="h-9">Use gerunds (verbs that end in "ing") correctly</h2>
	<p>Gerund are words that are formed with verbs but act as nouns.  This is done by adding "ing" to the end of a verb.</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Use gerunds in page titles and link names when the content is supporting the user's  understanding or learning of something</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-times text-danger"></span>Do no use gerunds for a specific call-to-action (the "doing" of something)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, "Buying a computer" might contain different computer options, specifications, ratings, etc. "Buy a computer" is the act of actually buying it.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <div class="row mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <div class="col-sm-5">
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><strong>Heading: </strong> "Starting a business"</li>
            <li> <strong>Links:</strong>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>"Planning a business"</li>
                <li>"Choosing a business name"</li>
                <li>"Registering your business with the government"</li>
                <li>"Applying for business permits and licences"</li>
                <li>"Getting business support and financing"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-7"> <img src="images/gerund-e.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div>
      </div>
      <p>For the call-to-action, use the active voice form of the verb. This means there is no  "ing". For example:</p>
      <div class="row mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <div class="col-sm-5">
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><strong>Heading:</strong> <br>
              "Incorporating federally"</li>
            <li><strong>Call-to-action:</strong> <br>
              "Incorporate a business" </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-7"> <img src="images/gerund2-e.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div>
      </div>
	<h2 id="h-10">Capitalize words correctly</h2>
<p>Capitalize the main words of:</p>

<ul>

<li>titles of official publications (such as reports, frameworks, strategies and plans)</li>

<li>institution names</li>

<li>program names</li>

<li>titles of policy instruments</li>

<li>titles of legislation (in other words, acts and regulations)</li>

<li>Government of Canada</li>

</ul>

<p>Lowercase the short form of proper names.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><strong>Full names</strong>: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canada Pension Plan<br>

<strong>Short form</strong>: the department, the plan</p>

<p>Don't capitalize all the letters in a word.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Abbreviations (although avoid them unless they're necessary)</li>

<li>Military exercise or operation names (for example, Operation PROVISION)</li>

</ul>

<p>Also refer to:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="../design/components/wet4/headings.html#h-1-5">Capitalization in headings</a></li>

<li><a href="../design/components/wet4/links.html#h-1-8">Capitalization in links</a></li>

<li><a href="../design/components/wet4/lists.html#h-1-2">Capitalization in lists</a></li>
